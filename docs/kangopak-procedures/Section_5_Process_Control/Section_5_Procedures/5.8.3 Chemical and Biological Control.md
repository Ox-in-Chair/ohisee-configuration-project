## OBJECTIVE

To ensure controls are in place to prevent contamination from chemical or biological hazards.

## METHOD

### Chemical control

Procurement of approved chemicals is done through an approved supplier and registered on the master list of chemicals for machine cleaning chemicals & lubricants and on the master schedule of detergents for cleaning detergents.

Material safety data sheets are maintained for all detergents, machine cleaning chemicals & lubricants.

New machine cleaning chemicals & lubricants are approved by the Operations Manager and listed on the master list of chemicals and approved suppliers list.

New cleaning detergents for the site are approved by the Admin Manager and listed on the master schedule of detergents.

Cleaning detergents, Maintenance Cleaning Chemicals & Lubricants are labelled and stored in secured demarcated areas.

No strongly scented products are utilised on site.

All containers of machine cleaning chemicals & lubricants are clearly labelled at all time and kept in the production cupboard and used only by trained personnel.

All containers of cleaning detergents are clearly labelled at all time and kept in the cleaning cupboard under the stairs and used only by trained personnel.

### Microbiological control

Potential for microbiological contamination and any potential allergens is assessed during the hazard and risk analysis. Refer to HACCP Study 2.0.

Furthermore pre-requisite programmes including:

- Personal hygiene practices
- Protective clothing standards
- Housekeeping and cleaning
- Pest control
- Waste Management
- Site standards

are implemented and maintained to prevent product contamination.

Swabs are performed annually on machinery and personnel to verify effectiveness of cleaning chemicals & water used for hand washing as per HACCP Study 2.0.

### Risk Assessment: Water Testing

Water testing is conducted as part of the risk assessment process to ensure water quality meets required standards for production and cleaning activities.
