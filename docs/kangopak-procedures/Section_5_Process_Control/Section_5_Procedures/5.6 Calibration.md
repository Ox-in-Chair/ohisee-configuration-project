# Procedure 5.6: Calibration Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 10
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Commercial Manager
**Status:** Current

## OBJECTIVE

To ensure that all relevant measuring equipment used to monitor critical manufacturing process points, product safety, quality and legality are calibrated.

## METHOD

### Measuring Devices

#### Registration

All measuring and test equipment is registered on the Calibration and Verification chart by the Commercial Manager.

#### Calibration and Verification charts

The chart details the following:

- Equipment description
- Asset number
- Location
- Allowable deviation
- Minimum and maximum range
- Risk
- Calibration / verification frequency
- Calibration / verification schedule

#### Tagging of Devices

Uncontrolled measuring devices are devices that do not affect product quality / food safety or legality; therefore, these devices are neither calibrated nor verified.

Controlled devices are tagged (where practical) as follows:

- Devices that are calibrated are tagged with a calibration sticker defining the asset No, date of calibration and next calibration due date
- Devices that are being checked are identified by a unique code which is linked to the calibration and verification chart by the Commercial Manager

### Calibration and verification of Devices

#### Calibration

Devices that are due for calibration are sent to an approved service provider.

Devices that fail the calibration are isolated and a Non-Conformance Advise is raised.

#### Verification

These devices are verified in house against a calibrated standard according to the relevant verification method and recorded on a Control of Inspection, Measuring and Equipment Check Record. This is done by the department's Team Leader.

Verification is performed at a predetermined frequency based on risk analysis, as per below:

- High Risk: Quarterly
- Medium Risk: Bi-Annually
- Low Risk: Annually

In the event of non-compliance, the device is isolated and the Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure is followed by the Departments Team Leader.

No adjustments to devices are made on site.

### Equipment Failure – Recording, Risk Assessment and Product Control

**Trigger (any of the following):**

- Failed calibration (external) or verification (in-house)
- Out-of-tolerance result at any verification point, damage, malfunction, missing/expired verification sticker, or unexplained drift during use
- Post-use discovery that a device used for release decisions (e.g., counting/bench scales, thickness/seal gauges, test fixtures) is inaccurate

**Immediate actions (record on 5.6F2 and raise an NCA):**

- STOP USE of the device; fit OUT OF SERVICE tag; isolate it
- Notify Team Leader and Operations Manager
- Open a Non-Conformance (NCA) referencing the device ID and failure mode; attach the 5.6F2 record

**Window of exposure & risk assessment (record in NCA and 5.6F2):**

- Determine time of last known good check/calibration and the time of failure detection; define the window of exposure
- Use Production Log Sheets, job card and labels to list all WIP/FG made in the window (work order, pallets, cartons)
- Assess risk to safety/legality/quality based on what the device controls (e.g., quantity/short count, seal width/integrity, dimensional fit, test result)

### Verification Method

The device is verified against the calibrated standard at 3 measurement points which are recorded on the Control of Inspection, Measuring and Test Equipment Record.

The deviation at the points is recorded and if the deviation falls outside the required tolerance then the device is isolated and the Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure is followed. This is done by the departments Team Leader.

### Calibration and Verification Files

The minimum file content for calibrated and verified equipment are the Following:

- Calibration and verification chart
- Calibration Certificates
- Company's Certificate of Accreditation

### Control of in-House Standards

Calibrated in house standards used for verifying purposes are stored under secure conditions by the Operations Manager, preventing unauthorised issue or use.

### Monitoring Devices

Monitoring devices which provide qualitative, indicative or comparative measures are tabled below together with a cross reference to the relevant procedure.

### Operation and Setting Up of Counting Scales

Counting scales are used to weigh the carton once they are fill with the required quantity of finished goods.

Counting scales must be used to verify the number of pouches packed into the finished goods carton as per the packing instruction is correct.

The setting up and operating of counting scales is done so as per 5.6.1 Work Instruction: Setting and Operation of Counting Scales.

**Pouch Making Machines:**
Pouch making machines have an automatic counter that batch the finished goods into a set quantity either OF 50 or 100. This is inputted into the machine HMI monitor.

These batches of finished goods are placed into the carton. When the desired number of batches are in the carton the packer/operator verifies the correct number of pouches are in the carton by utilising the counting scales as per the above Work Instruction 5.6.1.

Once satisfied with the accurate quantity in the carton the packer/operator will record the weight of the carton on the Production Log Sheet with the corresponding carton number and record the weight of the carton on the carton label together with their initial for traceability reasons.

**Spout Inserter Machines:**
Spout Inserter machines do not utilise an automatic counter.
Pouches are manually counted.

When the desired number of pouches are counted and placed into into the carton the packer/operator verifies the correct number of pouches are in the carton by utilising the counting scales as per the above Work Instruction, 5.6.1.

Once satisfied with the accurate quantity in the carton the packer/operator will record the weight of the carton on the Production Log Sheet with the corresponding carton number and record the weight of the carton on the carton label together with their initial for traceability reasons.

## Performance Measures and Reporting

- Devices verified / calibrated against Calibration and Verification Schedules. (Planned vs. Actual) as per internal audit findings
- Number and nature of Customer Complaints relating to Measuring and Monitoring devices – Recorded on NCA Trend Analysis
