| 1. **OBJECTIVE**   Documented procedures are in place to ensure effective quality assurance of operations throughout the process.   1. **METHOD**     1. **PROCESS ANALYSIS & REVIEW**       1. All Production processes are analysed & reviewed utilising Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment methodology (HACCP) addressing both Quality & Product Safety & Process variables by the Risk Team. Refer to the HARA studies    2. **MANAGING CRITICAL PROCESS POINTS**       1. Critical Control Points (CCPs), if applicable, are controlled through appropriate control measures, including:  * Trained, competent personnel * Equipment maintenance/calibration * Process specifications * Monitoring & Recording * Corrective action in the event of deviation   1. **SKILLS MATRIX**      1. Personnel whose work impacts product safety, quality, and legality are suitably trained and competent to carry out the work. The director develops and maintains skills matrices detailing the required skills and current competency levels.   2. **PROCESS SPECIFICATIONS**       1. Process specifications for the identified process variables are established & controlled.      2. Process specifications are contained together with the pouch specifications on the Job Card.      3. The Operations Manager creates the Job Card, & all process specifications are password-protected. Any deviations are stated on the Production Log Sheet.      4. If Process Specifications are outside tolerances, trained employees note this on the production log sheet. This step prevents non-conforming products and ensures their consistent quality and safety. If violated, the transgression would be not related to poor performance but rather misconduct in the disciplinary code.      5. Suppose changes need to be made to the job card process specifications. This is done if the Operations Manager deems the reasoning behind the out-of-spec results valid & necessary.   3. **PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS**      1. Product specifications detailing product information, i.e., product description, quality, safety, and legality, are developed, documented, and approved by the Director & Operations Manager and any other employee dealing with an end user of the product.This ensures product specifications are clearly defined, communicated, and adhered to throughout production to maintain quality and safety standards. This is done using a Pouch Specification Form.      2. **PROCEDURE:**         1. **SPECIFICATION DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL:**            1. The Director, in consultation with the Operations Manager, develops and documents product specifications.            2. These specifications include product description, quality, safety, and legality.         2. **POUCH SPECIFICATION FORM:**            1. Individuals involved in the inquiry for the product must generate the Pouch Specification Form to ensure compliance during production and job card generation.            2. The Pouch Specification Form aligns the customer with product safety and Product Specifications, ensuring they know what to expect.            3. The Pouch Specification Form must be sent with every order received, whether for stock standard finished products or custom finished products.            4. **PRODUCT SAFETY COMPLIANCE DATA IN THE POUCH SPECIFICATION FORM FOR THE USER AND THE PRODUCT'S INTENDED PURPOSE.**   Ensure raw materials comply with relevant FDA, EU, and other international regulations.  Conduct migration testing and verify transmission rates to ensure product integrity and safety.  Specify any limitations on use, such as storage conditions, temperature, and material suitability.  Emphasize customer maintaining traceability records for accountability and safety.   * + - * 1. **USAGE LIMITATIONS AND TRACEABILITY DATA IN THE POUCH SPECIFICATION FORM FOR THE USER AND THE PRODUCT'S INTENDED PURPOSE.**   State that the user must ensure the product's appropriateness for its intended application.  Defines the product's shelf life in line with Supplier’s recommendation.  Ensure traceability by retaining carton labels with traceability details.   * + - 1. **COMMUNICATION OF SPECIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTION:**          1. The Job Card communicates Product Specifications and packaging instructions to the personnel producing the finished product.          2. Where possible, specifications on the job card that are not applicable will be marked with a “–” to prevent any misinterpretation.          3. Final artwork will be available with the job cards to the production floor when applicable.          4. The artwork must be signed like the job card to match the product specifications.       2. **COMPLIANCE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:**          1. Personnel involved in product manufacture must follow the Work Instructions for Production (Bag Making, Spout Inserting, etc).          2. Every packer and operator must initial the job card to acknowledge the specifications and ensure accuracy. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct.          3. This includes initialling by the operator and the packer of the machine, regardless of their involvement duration, such as substituting during breaks.          4. Any discrepancies between the job card and artwork, when applicable, must be reported to the team leader or supervisor for clarification and amendment, if necessary. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct.          5. In the event of equipment failure or deviation of the manufacturing process from specification, 5.7 BRCGS Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure is followed to establish the quality status of the product and determine that action to be taken.       3. **CONVERSION WORK:**          1. For conversion work, the customer's responsible for providing details relating to the material's specifications and product safety aspects.          2. The Company will do everything possible to obtain all relevant product safety data on record in case of any recourse, whether legal, quality, or product safety related.          3. The Company will not accept any quality or legal liability due to the product safety aspect, the finished product, or the material supplied.          4. If material is found to be non-conforming after conversion work, the customer, not the company, is responsible.          5. Personnel should inform the client of this responsibility where reasonably and practicably possible.       4. **COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE:**           1. These steps are designed to ensure compliance with company rules, processes, and procedures and are not related to poor performance if violated. This process control ensures that product specifications are consistently met throughout the production sequence, maintaining high quality and safety standards.          2. The need for product inspection, testing, and measuring equipment is determined through HARA (Hazard and Risk Assessment) reviews and process requirements. Equipment such as counting scales, seal gauges, and dimensional tools are specified where they are necessary to ensure product safety, legality, and quality. This review occurs at least annually during Management Review or when new products, processes, or risks are introduced.          3. **Validation of Inspection, Testing, and Control Measures**   The site ensures that inspection, testing, and process control measures are validated for effectiveness prior to implementation. Validation activities confirm that checks are both accurate and reproducible, and that they reliably control hazards identified in the Hazard and Risk Analysis (HARA).  Validation is carried out through activities such as:   * Internal audits assessing the consistency of inspection and testing outcomes. * Review of production records to confirm that process parameters remain within defined limits. * Assessment of complaints, non-conformances, and customer feedback to identify gaps in control. * Review of product withdrawals or recalls to verify that controls are effective in preventing recurrence.   These activities provide assurance that both inspection/testing procedures and wider control measures (including PRPs and process checks) remain effective. Results are reviewed by the HARA team and Senior Management, ensuring that validation is embedded as part of the continual improvement cycle.   * 1. **PRODUCT STANDARDS – 1ST OFF & RETAINED SAMPLES**      1. The purpose of 1st off & Retained Samples is to ensure the consistent quality and safety of products through the retention and analysis of first-off and in-process samples.      2. **RETENTION OF FIRST-OFF SAMPLES i.e. RETAINED SAMPLES**         1. First-off samples and retention samples are retained for various reasons, including quality control, consistency verification, troubleshooting, customer assurance, regulatory compliance, maintaining a historical record, and as an insurance policy against quality issues.         2. Samples are retained at pre-determined intervals, typically every 2 hours, for post-job analysis.         3. This applies to pouch makers and spout inserter machines or any other production, especially in response to customer complaints and control of non-conforming product      3. **IN-PROCESS SAMPLE MANAGEMENT**         1. In-process samples (such as pouches used for water, template, and submersion tests) are discarded following the line clearance procedure to maintain a clutter-free and organised production environment.         2. This step is designed to prevent the contamination of conforming products by non-conforming products and ensure compliance with the Company’s Control of Foreign Bodies Contamination Procedure.         3. Violations of this step are considered misconduct rather than poor performance under the disciplinary code and procedure.      4. **RESPONSIBILITY**         1. The operator and packer are responsible for retaining First-off and Retained Samples by placing them with the Production Log Sheet and Job Card and ensuring they are cleared during post-job/shift line clearance.         2. Operators and packers must initial the job card to acknowledge the specifications, ensuring accuracy and preventing carelessness.         3. This applies regardless of their involvement duration, such as substituting during breaks.      5. **REPORTING DISCREPANCIES**         1. Any discrepancies between the job card and artwork must be reported to the team leader or supervisor for clarification and amendment. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct in terms of the disciplinary code.      6. **DOCUMENTATION AND ANALYSIS**         1. Retained and 1st off samples must be placed with the production log sheet and job card. These samples will be used as evidence of any neglect by the staff member involved, as indicated by their initials on the production log sheets.      7. **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**         1. Periodically review the retention sample procedure for potential improvements and update the process control procedure accordingly to adapt to new standards or identified gaps.      8. **ADDITIONAL NOTES:**         1. Providing evidence through retained samples helps build customer trust and resolves complaints more efficiently.      * + - 1. Keeping samples aids in demonstrating compliance with regulatory standards during audits and inspections.       2. Retained samples act as a safeguard against unexpected quality issues, ensuring there is recourse for investigation and resolution.       3. All of the above steps for prevent non-conforming products and ensure their consistent quality and safety. If violated, the transgression would be not related to poor performance but rather misconduct in terms of the disciplinary code.   1. **RAW MATERIAL AND CONSUMABLE SPECIFICATIONS AND TRACEABILITY.**   Materials that must be traceable are handled according to the following process control steps:  **Specification on Job Card** Raw materials required to create a finished product are specified on a production Job Card.  **Component Details:** Each component, including different gauges, widths, and constructions, is supported by a raw material specification obtained from the relevant supplier.  **Specification Changes:** If the supplier changes the specification, the Operations Manager must approve it prior to implementation through the HARA Review process.  **Employee Acknowledgement:** The employee initials the job card issued to production, indicating that they have read and understood the material specification. This includes all aspects of the material type, such as thickness, appearance, description, width, artwork, variant, size of the spout and cap, appearance, supplier name, size and opening force of the zipper, etc. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct under the disciplinary code.  **Recording Raw Materials:** Raw materials and other traceable items like carton liners, zippers, spouts, caps, and different types of film are captured on the production log sheet under the Material section immediately after being loaded into production to ensure traceability throughout the process. There are no exceptions to this process.  **Returning Traceable Items:** Should any traceable item need to be returned to the warehouse, it must be properly covered, labeled, and stored in its designated place. It is the responsibility of the employee returning the items to ensure labels are available, containing details identical to the supplier's details. Lack of labels is not an excuse for not having the relevant details. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct in terms of the disciplinary code.  **Handling Non-Conforming Items:** Any traceable items requiring non-conformance handling or input from a supplier are managed by the Warehouse Team Leader. This is done in consultation with the Operations Manager if required. Employees from production must make themselves available and comply with the Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure.  **Traceable Items Recorded:** The following traceable items are recorded on the Production Log Sheets and listed on the Raw Material Specification Register:   * Film * Zipper * Spouts * Caps * Virgin Poly Carton Liners   **Return to Stores Labels:**  Return to stores labels are required for the following items to maintain traceability:   * Film * Zipper * Spouts * Caps * Virgin Poly Carton Liners   + 1. Raw materials required to create a finished product are specified on a production Job Card.     2. Each component has different gauges and widths, as well as construction, and is supported by a raw material specification obtained from the relevant supplier.     3. If the supplier changes the specification, the Operations Manager approves it prior to implementation through the HARA Review process.     4. The employee initials the job card issued to production, indicating that they have read the material specification and understand which material to use. This includes all aspects of the material type, including but not limited to the thickness, appearance, description, width, artwork, variant, etc of the film, the size of the spout and cap and the appearance, the suppler name etc, the size and opening force of zipper etc. This step is designed to prevent non-conforming products and is not related to poor performance if violated but rather misconduct in terms of the disciplinary code.     5. Raw materials and other traceable items like carton liners, zippers, spouts, caps, and different film types are captured on the production log sheet under the Material section. This is done immediately after the material is loaded and brought into production to ensure traceability. There is no exception to the process.     6. Should any traceable item, as mentioned above, be required to be returned to the warehouse stores, they are to be done by covering and labelling and ensuring they are stored in their applicable place. The employee is responsible for returning the tractable items to ensure there are labels available for them to ensure complete traceability. Having no leaves is not an excuse for returning top stores' labels that do not have the relevant details. The details are those details that are the same as the supplier details.     7. Traceable Items that are recorded on the Production Log Sheets for traceability or any other listed on the Raw Material Specification Register, is:        1. Film        2. Zipper        3. Spouts        4. Caps        5. Virgin Poly Carton Liners     8. Return to stores labels are required to go on the following or any other listed on the Raw Material Specification Register to ensure the traceability is kept intact:        1. Film        2. Zipper        3. Spouts        4. Caps        5. Virgin Poly Carton Liners   1. **INCOMING MATERIAL INSPECTION PLAN**   Incoming Material Inspection Plans are available & define the following:   * Material Type * Specifications * Sampling & Test Method * Frequency * Responsibility * Record * COC Required or not     **Incoming Material Conformity**  Incoming material is verified for conformance prior to release to production – either through inspection & testing or through Supplier certificates of conformance by the Team Leader, Operator or Stock Controller.   * + 1. **Planned Preventive Maintenance Plans**   Maintenance Plans are adhered to as per the **Maintenance procedure**   * + 1. **Process Flow Diagram**   Each of the processes is defined on a Process Flow Chart detailing:-   * + Process Step   + Process Variables   + Product Attribute   + Hazards   + Control Method   The **Process Flow Diagram** is developed within **HACCP** studies by the Risk Team   * + 1. **Control of measuring & monitoring devices**   The control of measuring & monitoring devices is described in the control of **Calibration procedure**.   * + 1. **Traceability**   Product Identification & traceability is defined in the **Product Identification & Traceability procedure**   * 1. **In-process control**   **Documented Process Checking**  Documented process checks are maintained as defined below. Specific checks are conducted at start-up, predetermined intervals & following adjustments to equipment by the Team Leader, Setter Operator, Operator &/ Packer. Setting & Changes to the equipment settings shall only be completed by trained & authorised staff.  **2.9.1 Pre-Start-Up Checklist**  Settings for each product are automatically programmed into the machine. At the start-up or prior to any changeover of a machine, operators and packers conduct checks, which are recorded on the Production Log Sheet. These checks must adhere to the Work Instructions for Bag Making, including Pouch Makers, Spout Inserters, and Slitting Machines.   * Verify labels & documentation: Confirm all previous labels (carton, WIP, pallet, job/test labels) are removed/destroyed, and only current job labels are present at the line. * Confirm current job pack: Confirm previous manufacturing documentation (old job cards, specs, check sheets) is removed, and only the current job documentation is issued and available.   Suppose any equipment, process, or product is found to be damaged or non-conforming during the Pre-Start-Up Checks. In that case, the problem is rectified immediately to restore the machine to the correct condition, ensuring product safety and quality are not jeopardised.  Line Clearance Procedure: Line clearance is mandatory at the beginning of every run or work order, with the process documented on the Production Log Sheet. At start‑up and prior to any changeover, the line is confirmed clear of: (i) all previous work raw material, (ii) work in process (WIP), (iii) product and product packing, (iv) labels, and (v) manufacturing documentation.  The procedure includes the following critical components:  **Roles of Persons Involved in Line Clearance:**  The Team Leader/Another trained person confirms the current job card/spec number and the removal of previous labels and documents as part of the validation.  The operator and packer conduct the line clearance, which involves physically clearing and cleaning the production line. Before production can continue, the team leader or another trained person validates and signs off on the line clearance.  **Clearing:**  Before the start of each run or work order, operators and packers physically remove any unnecessary materials (all previous work raw material) from the previous process for the upcoming production. This includes unused parts, packaging, and other items that may cause contamination or interference with the new production run.  Remove all labels related to the previous job (carton/WIP/pallet/test prints) from the line, printers, and label storage points; issue only current‑job labels.  Remove previous manufacturing documents (job cards, specs, travellers, check sheets) from workstations and replace with current‑job documents.  **Cleaning:**  The operator and packer clean the line according to the depth of cleaning required, depending on whether the clearance is between batches of the same product or involves a product changeover. This may include wiping down surfaces, removing any residue or debris, and ensuring the area is free of contaminants.  **Areas Where Materials Can Become Trapped:**  Operators and packers pay special attention to areas where materials can become trapped, such as crevices, under equipment, or moving parts. These areas are thoroughly inspected and cleared of materials that could compromise product safety.  Special attention is paid to unwind/rewind stations, nip/guide rollers, forming shoulders, seal jaws/cutters, conveyors, under guards and inside machine bases and printer/label stations (including label drawers and shelves).  **Checking and Validation of the Line Clearance:**  After the operator and packer complete the clearing and cleaning, another trained person or team leader inspects the line. This inspection includes recalibrating scales, checking machine settings, and ensuring all necessary adjustments are made. Another trained person or team leader validates that the line is ready for production by signing off on the clearance. This validation, including the date and time of completion, is documented on the Production Log Sheet.  Record on the Production Log Sheet that previous labels and documentation have been removed and current job documents issued (include job card/spec reference).  **Sign-Off for Continuing Production:**  Production continues only after the supervisor or team leader signs off on the line clearance. This sign-off confirms that the line is clear of potential contaminants, that all materials have been properly managed, and that the line is safe for the next production run.  The sign‑off confirms the line is free of previous raw materials, WIP, product/packing, labels, and manufacturing documentation, and that validation checks have been completed.  **Continued End-of-Run Clearance**  Mandatory line clearance at the end of each run is an internal best practice. This end-of-run clearance does not require formal sign-off but remains a vital part of our internal quality control measures. The operator and packer are responsible for clearing, cleaning, and checking the line at the end of the run to maintain a clean and organised work environment.  Settings are automatically programmed per product on the machine. At the machine start-up, checks are recorded on a Production Log sheet.  **IMPORTANT: LINE CLEARANCE AND CHANGEOVER VALIDATION**  To ensure proper line clearance is performed and validated before production changeovers.  **Requirements:**  1. Line clearance must be performed at every product changeover  2. Line clearance must include removal of:  • All previous work raw materials  • Work in process from previous job  • Previous product and product packing  • Previous labels and documentation  • Previous job cards (to be placed in 'Completed Jobs' holder)  **Validation Requirements:**  **Line clearance MUST be validated by ANOTHER TRAINED PERSON (not the person who performed the clearance).**  Acceptable validators include:  • Another team leader  • A trained operator of similar skill level  • A packer with line clearance training  • A supervisor or manager  **The validator must:**  1. Be trained in line clearance verification procedures  2. Physically inspect the production line  3. Verify all items from previous job are removed  4. Review the completed line clearance checklist  5. Sign the validation section of Form  **IMPORTANT: Self-validation is NOT permitted under any circumstances. The person who performs the line clearance CANNOT validate their own work.**  **Job Card Storage:**  All job cards must be stored in designated plastic holders at each machine:  • Future job cards: In 'Future Jobs' holder  • Completed job cards: In 'Completed Jobs' holder  • NO job cards should be left on machines   * + 1. **1st off Sample**   The 1st off samples for Pouch Making Machine & Spout Inserter Machines are signed per shift as a reference for the in-process quality checks per line. 1st off samples is attached to the production log sheets at the end of production run.  In process checks are recorded on a Production log Sheet for the Pouch Making Machine, Spout Inserter & Slitting Machine.  **Short Interval control**  Machine Set-up, Process variables, Product attributes, & Quality Verification are recorded at a defined frequency on a **Production Log Sheets** & displayed at the line & used for further analysis if necessary.   * + 1. **Defect tagging**   Temporary repairs such as wire, string, tape, cardboard etc. shall only be permitted in emergencies & where product contamination is not at risk.  Temporary repairs shall be removed after each Job as per Line Clearance on Production Log Sheet.  Any temporary repairs that need attention shall be recorded on a maintenance job card & be scheduled for correction at the next weekly maintenance as per checklist within the week following identification of repairs required. (14 days)   * + 1. **Non-Conforming Product**   Product that does not conform to specification is held according to the **Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure.**  This includes out of specification conditions for Process Specifications as per the job card.   * + 1. **Line Clearance**   On completion of a specific Production run, when appropriate, the line is cleared to verify that no cross contamination can take place.  This line clearance is documented on the Production Log Sheet in accordance with the Work Instruction - Pouch Makers, Work Instruction for Spout Inserting - MDB & Work Instruction for Slitting Machine.   * 1. **Temporary Modifications/Repairs**   Operators and Packers are responsible for documenting any temporary modifications made to production machinery immediately in the designated section of the Production Log Sheet. The details of the modification must include the reason, date, and expected duration.  The operator must ensure that the temporary modification/repais is scheduled for correction by initiating a Maintenance Job Card (MJC). The MJC number must be recorded on the Production Log Sheet. Temporary modifications are intended to be short-term and should be removed immediately after the job is completed. If removal is not possible, the correction must be scheduled without delay.  Before starting the next job, the operator must verify whether the temporary modification has been removed. If not, the operator must ensure that it is intact and not posing any risk to product contamination. The team leader or supervisor must review the Production Log Sheet to verify that the operator has documented the temporary modification correctly and that it has been scheduled for correction via the MJC system. The supervisor must sign off on this verification.  At the completion of the job, the operator must confirm whether the temporary modification has been removed. If it has not been removed, the operator must ensure that it is still safe and note any reasons for the delay in correction on the Production Log Sheet. The supervisor must ensure that the Maintenance Job Card (MJC) has been completed and signed off. The MJC number should be cross-referenced with the Production Log Sheet to confirm that all temporary modifications have been addressed.  Supervisors are responsible for ongoing monitoring to ensure that all temporary modifications are managed according to this procedure. Any deviations from the procedure must be documented and addressed immediately.  All relevant staff must receive training on this updated procedure to ensure full understanding and compliance. The training should emphasize the importance of documenting, verifying, and correcting temporary modifications to prevent non-conformities.   * 1. **Change Control**      1. **Process Change Control**   In the event of changes to product composition, processing methods or equipment, the HARA study & relevant documentation are reviewed to re-establish characteristics & validate product data to ensure that product safety, legality & quality are achieved.  **2.12** **Quantity control & legislative compliance**  Where finished packaging is labelled and sold by quantity (e.g., count, mass, length, area), Kangopak complies with the Legal Metrology Act, 2014 and Legal Metrology Regulations, 2017, applying SANS 289 for quantity declarations and SANS 458/OIML R87 for average‑quantity and tolerances.  For counted cartons of pouches, we perform 100% bundle counts with independent verification on every carton and record verifier initials and bundle pattern on the Production Log Sheet as descried in 5.6 BRCGS Calibration Procedure and 5.6.1Work Instruction Setting and Operating of Counter Scales. If an item is not covered by legal metrology, we apply customer‑specified quantity requirements and retain the same level of recorded evidence.  2.13 **Product Release**  Finished products are released only after completion of all specified in‑process and final checks as per the Production Log Sheet, Job Card, and Work Instructions (Bag Making, Spout Inserting, Slitting).
