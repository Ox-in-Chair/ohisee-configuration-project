# Procedure 5.2: Graphic Design Artwork Control

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 6
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Current

## Objective

To ensure artwork and all pre-press processes conducted by Kangopak are managed to ensure loss of information and variation from customer specifications are eliminated.

## Method

### Product Development

The requirement for Graphic Design and Artwork control will be established as per the Product Development Procedure. New products or product changes shall be subject to suitable evaluation to ensure that required safety and quality parameters can be achieved.

### Print Trials

Where appropriate print trails are carried out to validate that the agreed product quality and print standards can be consistently achieved.

### Artwork Management

Die line/Work maps are drawn up by the Operations Manager. These die lines/work maps are sent through to the raw material supplier who will be printing the material, together with the final artwork received from the customer in PDF format.

If the customer wishes to superimpose the artwork onto the die line/work map themselves the die lines/work maps are sent through to the customer. This work map/die line will be sent through to the raw material supplier once received back from the customer by the Operations Manager.

Kangopak does not collate any artwork on behalf of the customer.

The raw material supplier will have artwork proofs made up.

This artwork proof will be sent back to Kangopak. The Operations Manager must ensure that the raw material will be printed in such a way, as seen on the proof, that it will meet Kangopak's production capabilities.

### Customer Acceptance and Approval

Once the Operations Manager is satisfied with the artwork it is converted into an electronic PDF file for signing. This artwork is sent to the customer by the Director or Operations Manager.

The customer will sign off to verify the artwork is satisfactory, including any product specific claims e.g. chain of custody.

If any amendments are required, another proof will need to be made up by the raw material supplier and this proof must be checked again by the Operations Manager where it is converted into an electronic PDF file for signing by the customer.

Once the signed off artwork proof is received, it is sent back to the raw material supplier, for the origination of plates/stereos to occur.

In the event of the Customer making amendments to the artwork proof, the proofs are reworked by the printer and resubmitted to the Customer for final approval.

### Print Process

During the OPA process, the Customer or designated proxy will be present to approve the print standard.

Validation of accuracy of data transferred: Once the Customer or designated proxy is satisfied that the print conforms to their requirements, they will give final approval to proceed with the printing of the job by signing the "1st offs"

Customer approved "1st offs" from initial OPA of printed material/colour standards are filed and retained by the Printer for future reference.

The designated proxy is nominated by the Customer by way of the On Press Approval (OPA) Authority Approval Form. This is sent by the Director to the Customer before the OPA.

### Conversion of Trademark Material into Trademark Finished Product

The electronic proof that has been signed off by the customer and Kangopak is printed in colour and on A3 paper for ease of use by the Operation Manager.

This approved artwork is made available together with the job card at the time of production and during production in order for relevant employees to do visual checks and ensure specifications are correct throughout production run.

The approved artwork is initialed by the setter operator, operator and packer/s ensuring acknowledgement of the artwork.

No artwork that is not approved by the customer and Kangopak can be used for production.

### Tracking of Graphic Design and Artwork

The Printed Pouch Checklist is used in order to track the progress of the graphic design and artwork process so that no vital steps are omitted. This checklist is completed by the Director.

### Changes to Artwork and Print Specification

Subsequent amendments to artwork are handled in the same manner as above.
