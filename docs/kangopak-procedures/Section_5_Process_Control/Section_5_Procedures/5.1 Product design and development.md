summary: |
  Establishes systematic product design and development processes from concept through manufacturing,
  ensuring production of safe, legal products to defined quality parameters through defined phases
  including feasibility, trial production, and manufacturing implementation.

key_requirements:
  - Customer requirements defined via Customer Questionnaire for printed and unprinted products
  - Pouch Specification Forms with Material Data Sheets agreed upon
  - Functional Packaging Claims stated with test report references on specifications
  - Production trials validate product safety, legality, and quality producibility
  - Settings from successful trials transferred to manufacturing process control documentation
  - Job Cards derived from Pouch Specification Forms for production control
  - 1ST off samples retained from each shift of each production run per Process Control Procedure
  - No post-consumer recycled material used in finished product manufacture

scope: "Product design and development process covering concept, feasibility, trial production, and manufacturing for both printed and unprinted packaging products at Kangopak facilities"

# Procedure 5.1: Product Design and Development

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 13
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Objective

To ensure that product design processes result in the production of safe & legal products to defined quality parameters.

## Method

### Design and Development Process

The Product Design & development Process is summarised below:

#### Concept & Feasibility

Customer Requirements are defined and agreed upon taking into consideration current process capacities and capabilities.

This must be done for both printed and unprinted product by means of the Customer Questionnaire.

Once requirements are established a Pouch Specification Form together with Material Data Sheets are agreed upon.

Where Functional Packaging Claims are required, this is stated on the Pouch Specification Forms with reference to, at minimum, test report number and date of report. This is also included on Certificate of Conformance to Customers, if applicable.

#### Trial and Production

This phase is designed to validate that the product is safe, legal and able to be produced to the required quality.

Production trials may be required during the development of new products, a customer requirement, risk assessment, revalidation of process controls and to ensure that new techniques for production are able to be maintained.

Settings derived from successfully conducted manufacturing trials or equipment installations are transferred to manufacturing process control documentation.

A Job Card is derived from the Pouch Specification Form.

The results from the production run are recorded on a Production Log Sheet & given the successful outcome of the trial a Customer approved Pouch Specification Form is obtained.

#### Manufacturing

This is the production of safe & legal products with relevant manufacturing controls in place to ensure that customer requirements & Produce-ability requirements have been achieved.

### Sample Retention

Sample retention is in accordance with Process Control Procedure. 1ST off samples are retained from each shift of each production run.

No post-consumer recycled material is used in the manufacturer of finished products.
