|  |  | Mark (x) in each month when the equipment must be calibrated or checked – shade the block **and record the calibration date** once calibration is done | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | **x** |
|  |  | No adjustments are made to devices on site. If the Equipment does not meet the required tolerance during calibration / verification then it must be isolated and Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure is followed | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
