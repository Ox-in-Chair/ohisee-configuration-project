# Procedure 5.7: Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 9
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Warehouse Team Leader
**Status:** Current

## OBJECTIVE

To ensure that out-of-specification product is clearly identified, labelled and quarantined to prevent it from reaching customers.

## METHOD

### Definition

**Non-conformances** are where a finished product, raw material, packaging material or work-in-process product has deviated from the specification.

**An incident** is an event that has occurred that may result in the production or supply of unsafe, illegal or non-conforming products.

**Corrective action** is the Action to eliminate the cause of a detected non-conformity/incident.

### Raw Material, Work in Progress & Finished Product Non-Conformance

#### Raw Material & Finished Product Non-Conformance

Where raw material or finished product does not conform to the required specification it is recorded on a Non-Conformance Advice (NCA).

Once recording is complete the NCA is kept in the NCA book and placed in the NCA holder on the wall in the factory. This book is checked daily by the Warehouse Team Leader for any new NCAs that may have risen during the course of the previous shifts.

NCA is emailed to the material supplier if applicable by Warehouse Team Leader.

The NC product is positively identified as being non-conforming by means of a "Hold" sticker. This sticker is RED and contains traceability details that can be referenced to the completed NCA.

Segregation is undertaken whereby the non-conforming product is moved into a non-conforming area in the warehouse. In the case where by product is unable to be stored in a segregated area or it becomes not practical, NC product is clearly labelled to reduce this risk of cross contamination.

#### Status of the Non-Conforming Product - (Disposition)

The status of the non-conforming product is determined by the Warehouse Team Leader with consult Operations and Factory Team Leaders, and recorded on the NCA. This includes either, Reject, Rework/Sorting and/or Concession.

NCAs/Incidents are logged on the NCA Register. This is done by the Warehouse Team Leader once the NCA has been reviewed and disposition of NC product is determined.

Analysis is conducted and reports for management review meetings are prepared using the NCA Register.

#### Work in Progress (WIP) Non-Conformance

WIP is monitored in accordance with the Production Log Sheet (Short Interval Control).

WIP found to be non-conforming is recorded on the production log sheets with the NCA number and the Control of NC product procedure is followed in the same manner as Finished Goods.

Back tracking of Finished Product is conducted to ensure no cross contamination and NC product ending up at Customers. The Factory Team Leader from relevant department where NCA occurred must sign the NCA form as verification that effective Back Tracking has occurred to ensure no NC product is sent to the customer.

This verification is done by the Team Leader signing in the space provided on the NCA. This will ensure a responsible person has taken the necessary steps to reduce the risk of ill quality or risk to product safety.

When an out of process specification condition is encountered the operator or setter operator will complete an NCA in order to create awareness of the out of process specification condition which is then taken to the Team Leader for sign off in the space provided on the NCA to ensure a responsible person has done the quality checks required to prevent risk to product safety or quality.

Once the Factory Team Leader is satisfied he/she will give a concession when the manufacture of the bag is in order and production can commence.

An NCA form is completed in order to trend these out of specification conditions and record said concession.

### Investigation / Root Cause Analysis

Proper cause analysis is conducted to identify and eliminate the cause of detected non conformities incidents, to prevent recurrence, and to bring the process or system back under control after the non-conformity incident is encountered.

Root Cause Analysis must take place immediately once NC is detected identifying how and why product is non-conforming or why and how an incident took place. This is recorded on the NCA in space provided.

This root cause analysis will be used to implement ongoing improvements and to prevent recurrence of non-conformities in the event of:

- An analysis of non-conformities for trends which shows that there has been a significant increase in a type of non-conformity
- A non-conformity which places the safety, legality, integrity or quality of a product at risk (including withdrawals)
- The results of internal, second- or third-party audits
- Customer complaints
- Failure of in-line testing equipment
- Any incidents

#### Method of doing Root Cause Analysis when a significant in the trends are identified

The nominated person and/or responsible person must determine the cause by using a systematic approach. Details of the cause must be recorded. Any additional documentation relating to the NCA must be attached to the NCA.

When determining the cause of the problem, a root cause analysis such as the Ishikawa diagram is helpful when the cause is not obvious (Man, Machine (measuring equipment), Method, Environment, Material, Measuring).

### Corrective action

Based on the root cause analysis the required corrective action taken is recorded on the NCA to assist with communicating close outs and for tracking of trends.

### Close Outs of NCAs

NCAs must be closed out within 20 working days from date opened and can only be done so when the corrective actions have occurred and disposition of product is determined.

### NCA Review

A review of the NCA register is done to identify and action any overdue items. (Refer to NCA trend analysis 5.7.F2). This is done by the Commercial Manager on a weekly basis.

This is to:

- Follow up on overdue NCAs
- Analyse the nature of the NCAs raised
- Resolve / reschedule items as required

The effectiveness of the NCA System as a whole is analysed and evaluated at Management Review.

### Incident Management Follow Up

The company shall determine and document the activity required to effectively manage an incident to prevent release of product where hygiene, safety or quality may have been affected:

- Any NC product is positively identified as being non-Conforming by means of a "Hold" sticker. This sticker is RED and contains traceability details that can be referenced to the completed NCA
- Segregation is undertaken whereby the non-conforming product is moved into a non-conforming area in the warehouse
- Proper cause analysis is conducted to identify and eliminate the cause of detected non conformities incidents and bring the process or system back under control after the non-conformity incident is encountered
- All NCAs resulting from incidents are handed to the Warehouse Team Leader for determination of disposition of product and positive release of conforming products
