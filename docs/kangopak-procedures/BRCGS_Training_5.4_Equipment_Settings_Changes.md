**Kangopak Procedure:** Manufacturing Process Control

# Changes to Equipment Settings Critical to Safety/Legality Training

**Module:** Changes to Equipment Settings Critical to Safety/Legality  
**Audience:** Setter operators, team leaders, and maintenance personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 2.7.3, 5.4.4, 5.4.6  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.4 Manufacturing Process Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** which equipment settings are critical to product safety and legality
2. **Follow** proper authorisation procedures before making setting changes
3. **Document** all setting changes according to company procedures
4. **Understand** the consequences of unauthorised setting changes

## Why Equipment Setting Controls Matter

Equipment settings directly affect product quality, safety, and legal compliance. Incorrect settings can produce unsafe packaging, cause customer complaints, or result in regulatory violations.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (2.7.3):** Where equipment settings are critical to the safety or legality of the product, changes must be completed by trained and authorised personnel.

**Kangopak Standard:** All changes to critical equipment settings require written authorisation and must be documented with reasons and approval signatures.

## Critical Equipment Settings at Kangopak

### Pouch Making Machines
- **Seal temperature:** Affects package integrity and Product Safety
- **Seal pressure:** Critical for proper package closure
- **Film thickness:** Impacts barrier properties and shelf life
- **Speed settings:** Affects seal quality and product safety

### Spout Inserter Machines  
- **Spout insertion force:** Critical for package integrity
- **Alignment settings:** Ensures proper spout positioning
- **Quality check parameters:** Affects product acceptance/rejection

### General Production Equipment
- **Temperature controls:** Critical for material properties
- **Pressure settings:** Affects product formation and safety
- **Speed parameters:** Impacts quality and safety outcomes
- **Safety interlock settings:** Must never be altered without authorisation

## Who Can Change Settings

### Authorised Personnel Only
- **Setter operators:** Trained and certified for specific machines
- **Team leaders:** With appropriate technical training
- **Maintenance technicians:** For maintenance-related adjustments
- **Engineering staff:** For technical modifications

### Training Requirements
- **Initial certification:** Must complete machine-specific training
- **Competency assessment:** Demonstrated ability to make safe adjustments
- **Annual refresher:** Updates on procedures and safety requirements
- **Documentation:** Training records maintained in personnel files

## Setting Change Procedures

### Before Making Changes
1. **Check authorisation:** Confirm you have written permission to adjust settings
2. **Review work instructions:** Follow documented procedures for the specific machine
3. **Record current settings:** Document existing parameters before changes
4. **Risk assessment:** Consider potential impact on product safety and quality

### Making the Changes
1. **Follow procedures:** Use only approved methods and sequences
2. **Use correct tools:** Ensure calibrated instruments are used for adjustments  
3. **Make incremental changes:** Adjust settings gradually, not in large steps
4. **Monitor effects:** Watch for immediate impact on product quality

### After Making Changes
1. **Test production:** Run test samples to verify setting effectiveness
2. **Document changes:** Record new settings, reasons, and approval signatures
3. **Quality check:** Ensure product meets all safety and quality requirements
4. **Communicate changes:** Inform next shift about modifications made

## Documentation Requirements

### Setting Change Record
- **Date and time:** When changes were made
- **Equipment identification:** Machine name and number
- **Settings changed:** Specific parameters adjusted
- **Old vs new values:** Before and after measurements
- **Reason for change:** Why adjustment was necessary
- **Authorisation:** Signature of person approving change
- **Results:** Impact on product quality and safety

### Production Log Integration
- All setting changes must be recorded on production log sheets
- Include batch/lot numbers affected by the changes
- Note any product that may require special attention or testing
- Cross-reference with quality control records

## Practical Factory Examples

### DO's ✓
- **Get written approval:** Never change critical settings without authorisation
- **Follow work instructions:** Use documented procedures for all adjustments
- **Record everything:** Document all changes with full details
- **Test thoroughly:** Run samples to verify changes are effective
- **Communicate clearly:** Tell next shift about any modifications made

### DON'Ts ✗
- **Never guess:** Don't estimate what settings should be
- **Never rush:** Take time to make adjustments carefully and safely
- **Never skip documentation:** All changes must be recorded
- **Never work alone:** Have supervision when learning setting changes
- **Never ignore alarms:** Address safety warnings before proceeding

## Emergency Situations

### When Immediate Changes Are Needed
- **Safety hazards:** If current settings create immediate danger
- **Product contamination risk:** When settings threaten product safety
- **Equipment protection:** To prevent damage to machinery

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Stop production:** Ensure safety before making changes
2. **Get immediate approval:** Contact supervisor or manager
3. **Document thoroughly:** Record emergency nature of changes
4. **Follow up:** Complete formal documentation after emergency

## What Happens When Procedures Aren't Followed

**Immediate consequences:**
- Production stopped until proper authorisation obtained
- Potential product safety issues requiring investigation
- Non-conformance report and corrective action required

**Serious consequences:**
- Customer complaints about product quality or safety
- Regulatory violations and potential legal action
- Product recalls costing thousands of pounds
- Loss of customer trust and BRCGS certification

## Common Setting Change Scenarios

### Routine Adjustments
- **Product changeovers:** Settings adjusted for different package sizes
- **Quality improvements:** Minor adjustments to improve seal quality
- **Preventive maintenance:** Settings restored after equipment service

### Non-Routine Changes  
- **New product development:** Settings for products not made before
- **Equipment modifications:** Changes following machinery upgrades
- **Problem solving:** Adjustments to resolve quality issues

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **Who can authorise changes to critical equipment settings?**
   - Answer: Only trained and authorised personnel such as setter operators, team leaders, or maintenance staff

2. **What must you do before changing any critical setting?**
   - Answer: Get written authorisation, record current settings, and review work instructions

3. **If you notice a safety hazard requiring immediate setting changes, what should you do?**
   - Answer: Stop production, get immediate supervisor approval, make necessary changes, and document thoroughly

4. **Where must all setting changes be documented?**
   - Answer: On setting change records, production log sheets, and maintenance documentation

## Simple Practical Activity (10 minutes)

**Setting Change Documentation Exercise:**

1. **Scenario review:** Trainer presents realistic setting change scenarios
2. **Documentation practice:** Participants complete setting change forms
3. **Approval simulation:** Practice getting proper authorisation
4. **Problem identification:** Identify issues with improper procedures
5. **Best practices:** Discuss proper communication and documentation

## Supervision and Monitoring

### Initial Training Period
- **Close supervision:** New personnel supervised for all setting changes
- **Gradual independence:** Supervision reduced as competency demonstrated
- **Regular assessment:** Ongoing evaluation of performance and safety

### Ongoing Monitoring
- **Random checks:** Supervisors verify procedures are followed
- **Documentation reviews:** Regular audit of setting change records
- **Quality correlation:** Link setting changes to product quality outcomes
- **Continuous improvement:** Learn from setting change experiences
