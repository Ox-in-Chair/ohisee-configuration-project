## Objective, Definition & Adherence

Ensure equipment is designed and used effectively for its intended purpose and food safety and adequately maintained to minimise the risk of product contamination.

To ensure a documented planned maintenance system is in place, covering all manufacturing and support service equipment and plant items critical to product safety, legality and quality.

## Definition of Maintenance

Maintenance involves a range of activities to ensure that machinery and equipment operate efficiently, safely, and reliably. It includes preventive and corrective actions to maintain the equipment's operational readiness and prevent unexpected failures that could disrupt production or pose safety hazards.

### Maintenance Activities May Include

- **Inspection and Monitoring**: Regular checks on machinery and equipment to identify potential issues before they lead to breakdowns. This includes checking for wear and tear, leaks, or any signs of malfunction
- **Cleaning and Lubrication**: Ensuring all moving parts are clean and well-lubricated to reduce friction and wear and to maintain optimal performance
- **Adjustments and Calibrations**: Fine-tuning machinery settings to ensure precision and accuracy in operations
- **Replacement of Worn or Damaged Parts**: Replacing parts that have ended their service life
- **Repairs and Overhauls**: Fixing broken or malfunctioning equipment components
- **Software and Program Updates**: Ensuring all programmable logic controllers (PLCs), drives, and other control systems are current with the latest software and firmware versions
- **Safety Checks**: Verify that all safety features and mechanisms, including emergency stops, guards, and sensors, are functioning correctly
- **Operational Testing**: Running equipment under operational conditions to ensure that all repairs and adjustments have been successful and that the machinery is ready for production
- **Drilling and Tapping**: Creating holes and threads in components as required
- **Grinding**: Smoothing or shaping parts using abrasive wheels
- **Welding**: Joining metal parts together using high heat
- **Cutting and Fabricating**: Shaping and forming materials to create specific components
- **Aligning and Setting**: Ensuring that components are correctly positioned and aligned for optimal operation
- **Changing of Bearings**: Replacing worn bearings to ensure smooth operation of rotating parts
- **Testing and commissioning**: Verify that new or repaired equipment functions correctly before full operational use

### Types of Machinery and Equipment Typically Maintained

- Heaters and Thermocouples: Used for controlling and monitoring temperature
- Rollers and Cutting Blades: Essential for precise cutting and shaping of materials
- Element Bars: Heating elements that help in sealing and forming
- Pressure Cylinders and Read Switches are used in pneumatic systems to control and monitor the pressure and position of components
- Pneumatics: Air-driven systems that operate various machinery parts
- Programs and Drives: Software and electronic drives that control the machinery operations
- Motors and Belts: Drive components that power the machinery
- Compressors: Provide compressed air for pneumatic systems and other machinery functions

Equipment not in use/Taken out of service: Shall be cleaned and stored in a manner that does not pose a product safety risk.

### What Maintenance Includes and What It Does Not

- **Includes**: Any activities listed above performed by authorised and qualified personnel, which ensure the safe and efficient operation of machinery and equipment
- **Does Not Include**: any unauthorised or unqualified attempts to repair or adjust machinery or any activities not related to the upkeep and safe operation of equipment

## Unauthorised Maintenance

Under no circumstances may unauthorised maintenance be undertaken by any personnel, regardless of the reason. Only authorised and qualified personnel are permitted to perform maintenance. This conduct will not be tolerated and will result in severe disciplinary action. Unauthorised maintenance breaches company policy, rules, protocols, and procedures and poses significant safety risks. This strict policy ensures the safety of all staff and the integrity of our operations. Violations are a severe offence and will be dealt with accordingly.

## Method

### Supervisors – In Terms of the OHS Act

There are appointed Supervisors for each department per the Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) Act that have various responsibilities outlined below, but not limited to:

- Ensure the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and its regulations are always met
- Ensure that trained, competent persons perform all work
- Ensure that all company requirements/standards/procedures are always complied with
- Ensure that all persons are aware of the hazards attached to the work and are fully conversant regarding the precautionary measures to be taken or observed to avoid such dangers
- Ensure that the required risk assessments are carried out
- Ensure that discipline is consistently enforced at the workplace
- Stop any work which is deemed to be unsafe
- Report any deviations from the instructions mentioned above that the Supervisor cannot rectify to a superior as per the organogram immediately

Supervisors are not limited to working only within their departments, as supervisors from other departments may see unsafe acts and conditions.

### Condition Monitoring – (At Predetermined Frequency)

The Maintenance Technician checks and records the condition of the machines critical to product safety, legality, and quality on the Maintenance Checklists as per the Maintenance Plan for each machine.

Any deviation of machine condition during machine checks at the predetermined frequency would raise a maintenance job card. The Maintenance Technician raises a maintenance job card.

Machines are inspected during start-up, shift handover, or the commencement of every new work order to prevent the risk of product contamination or quality defects.

This is recorded on the Production Log Sheet as pre-start-up Checks being completed. The operator and packer responsible for each machine do this.

Machines are locked out before the employee performs maintenance to ensure a safe working environment.

### Planned Preventative Maintenance

Maintenance plans indicate when machines are due for planned maintenance and what maintenance checks need to be conducted for each machine/equipment.

Quarterly, Bi-annual & annual planned maintenance is included on the Key Events Calendar.

After the required maintenance checks are completed and necessary maintenance is carried out, the Maintenance Checklist is updated to record the Planned Preventative Maintenance the employee is conducting.

The Maintenance Technician routinely maintains and calibrates or verifies all critical regulating controls and temperature gauges according to the Calibration procedure.

### New (and new to the site) Equipment

New (and new to the site) equipment are required to be properly specified before purchase. The documented specification includes:

- Details of intended use if the equipment and the type of materials it will be handling
- Where applicable, suitability for open product contact surfaces to meet food safety and hygiene standards
- The equipment should be designed for easy maintenance access to facilitate ongoing cleaning and servicing without compromising hygiene
- Furthermore, all components must comply with applicable local and international regulations, including EU Regulation 1935/2004 and 10/2011 concerning materials intended to come into contact with food

Suppliers are required to provide evidence that equipment meets these requirements prior to supply.

This is documented in 4.6F2 Supplier Compliance Checklist - New Machinery.

### Installation and Commissioning

- **Commissioning Plan**: Supplier submits a risk-based commissioning plan that covers delivery, installation, FAT and SAT. The plan includes installation steps, testing protocols and hygiene safeguards
- **Pre-Installation Inspection**: On arrival, Maintenance Technician confirms the equipment received matches the approved purchase specification. For prefabricated units, a Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) is completed at the supplier's site before shipment, FAT report travels with the machine
- **Functional Verification / SAT**: After installation and before use, Maintenance Technician verifies all operational parameters, limits and tolerances in the user manual can be achieved, ensuring required hygiene performance. A Site Acceptance Test (SAT) is carried out to confirm functional performance under production conditions
- **Post-Installation Contamination Clearance**: Maintenance job card is raised with a detailed description of the installation work. Post-Hygiene Clearance section of the job card is completed and signed off before production resumes to confirm that all contamination hazards have been removed
- **Site Procedure Updates**: Risk Team performs a HARA review for every addition or modification to plant or equipment. All impacted documents are updated: training materials, SOPs, cleaning protocols, environmental monitoring, maintenance schedules, internal audits, etc.
- **Post-Maintenance Cleaning SOP**: Cleaning is completed and recorded before the equipment is released back to production

This will be assessed using 4.6F1 Commissioning Checklist.

New machinery/equipment is added to a Maintenance Plan once installed. This must occur within two months of commissioning to reduce the new machinery's wear and tear risk. The Maintenance Technician does this by consulting with relevant employees in relevant departments where machinery or equipment is installed.

### Repairs / Breakdowns / Reactive / Corrective Maintenance

Corrective Maintenance is carried out by an authorised or qualified skilled person so that production on adjoining lines or equipment is safe from contamination.

Critical system monitoring devices are linked to failure warnings on PLC.

A Maintenance job card system is used for all work on Production Lines resulting from any stoppage affecting the line or where repair requirements are identified that may pose a risk to product safety, quality, legality & OHS.

Any staff member raises a maintenance job card, which the Maintenance Technician closes out upon completion of maintenance, provided all safeties are in place and working order.

Machines are locked out before the employee performs maintenance to ensure a safe working environment.

### Call Out

This protocol outlines the steps for staff to follow when a call-out is required after hours.

It ensures that all maintenance, including but not limited to cut-off blades, electrical issues, temperature controllers, elements, and thermocouples, is performed safely and efficiently.

No maintenance should be performed without calling out the Maintenance Technician and issuing a maintenance job card.

#### Protocol

**Call-Out Initiation**: In the event of a maintenance issue occurring outside of ordinary working hours (17:00 - 08:00 Monday to Friday, 07:00 - 17:00 on Saturday, Sunday, and Public Holidays), the on-duty supervisor or designated contact person must immediately contact the Maintenance Technician.

**Maintenance Job Card Issuance**: A maintenance job card must be issued for every call-out. This job card must include a detailed description of the maintenance required, including what transpired before the maintenance was performed.

**Health and Safety Compliance**: All staff must adhere to health and safety regulations, ensuring a safe working environment. No maintenance should be performed by any unqualified or unauthorised personnel.

**Unauthorised Maintenance**: Performing unauthorised maintenance violates company rules, regulations, and procedures and violates the Kangopak Disciplinary Code prohibiting tampering with company equipment without authorisation.

### Process of Maintenance Job Cards

Maintenance job cards are issued to the Maintenance Technician, who reviews and prioritises jobs according to urgency and risk. Jobs may be assigned to specific service providers.

When reactive maintenance occurs, a Maintenance Job Card must be made out first by anyone requiring maintenance, indicating what repairs need to be performed or a description of necessary care before any maintenance occurs by the Maintenance Technician.

When a job card is made out for reactive maintenance during production, the job card number must be filled out on the production log sheet at the appropriate time, along with the corresponding carton for traceability by the operator and packer.

All repairs must be indicated on the job card, a Post-Hygiene Clearance must be completed, and the job card must be signed off before any production can commence.

Any product that may have been affected must be handled as per the Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure.

Maintenance job cards are only closed once complete and post-hygiene clearance is done and signed off.

### Post-Maintenance Cleaning

Before maintained equipment/machinery is released to production, it is cleaned and inspected.

This is recorded on the Maintenance job cards being completed.

Employees clear away tools and other maintenance equipment after use and store it in designated areas, such as Lin Bins, Shadow Board, and Workshop.

Any loose bolts, washers, screws, feral, lugs etc. must be accounted for and cleared up, put away in the designated area or discarded, if broken, always.

Production can only commence after the completion of the Post-Hygiene Clearance, and the job card is closed to reduce the risk of foreign body contamination.

### Sealers Bars, Cooler Bars, Pads & Teflon

Pads, Teflon, and sealer bars must be changed at the start of every job and every shift changeover. This should also be done after inspections that may have identified deviations from the standard operating procedure in production across all departments.

The Operators and Packers perform checks at shift changeover and the start of every new work order to ensure that they are free of impurities and not damaged.

Sealer bars and pads are stored by the operators and packers and readily available on the factory tooling racks to ensure swift equipment change.

Monitoring reduces the risk to product safety and quality, and strict adherence to this procedure is imperative for all employees.

### Defect Tagging

Temporary repairs, such as wire, string, tape, cardboard, etc., shall only be permitted in emergencies and where product contamination is not at risk.

Any temporary repairs that need attention shall be recorded on a maintenance job card, issued to the Maintenance Technician and scheduled for correction at the next weekly maintenance as per the checklist within the week following identification of repairs required. (14 days)
