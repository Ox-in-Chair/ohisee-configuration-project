| **Scope:**  The conversion of printed and plain flexible laminates (PET/LLDPE, BO Nylon/LLDPE) and metallised plastic laminates (MET PET/LLDPE) into stand-up (doy-packs), folded gusseted, 3-side seal, quad seal and spout pouches for food, beverage, personal care and industrial applications.  Slitting and rewinding various raw material reels of film for the eventual use as raw material on the Pouch Making Machines as stated above.  **Objective:**  To ensure a multidisciplinary Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team is in place to develop and manage the hazard and risk analysis system and ensure this is fully implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness.  To implement and maintain a formal Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessmentsystem to ensure that all hazards to product safety, quality and legality are identified and appropriate controls established.  **Products:**   * Stand-up pouches (doy-pouches) * Flat pouches * Spout pouches * Quad seal pouches   **Hazards considered**:   * Microbiological Hazards   + Hand Wash Basin at entrance of Factory.   + Bacterial contamination risk from cooler bars leaking.   + Water contamination from cooling system is considered as it is a closed cycle and the water may come into contact with the product if leaking due to being broken.     - * + Planned Maintenance to prevent potential risk to Product Safety from any leaks at connections/fitting of pipes.   + Microbiological hazards that may impact product safety of raw materials of finished goods at the Slitting Department * Foreign Objects;   + Temporary modifications are considered where product safety and quality is at risk.   + Foreign Body Contamination that may impact product safety of raw materials at the Slitting Department   + The workshop is included in the Site Schematic and potential foreign body contamination is controlled by swarf mats and the workshop door being closed at all times. ‘Clean as you go Policy in place’. Training given to employees.   + Potential Risks introduced from the building structure are considered under foreign objects and preventative measures include Site Standard procedure, housekeeping and cleaning procedure as well as the storage procedure.   + Malfunctioning equipment was considered as a risk however there are checks in place at required frequency during production of the products to ensure that equipment that may pose a risk to product safety and quality if this equipment malfunctions are identified and rectified. Preventive measures include process control, a maintenance procedure & a control of non-conforming procedure.   + These include:   Back Gusset Punch punching correctly  Condition of Teflon.  Condition of Rubber Draw Rollers   * Core dust and debris from the core is considered a Foreign Body Hazard. Housekeeping and Cleaning in place. Clean as you go. Trained employees. Covered product in stores. * **Skylight Hazard Risk Assessment**   **Physical Hazard - Overhead Infrastructure:**  Transparent skylights polycarbonate panels are installed directly above the product path in the pouch-making production area. These skylights present a potential physical contamination risk from material degradation, impact damage, or structural failure that could result in foreign body contamination of exposed product or packaging materials.  **Risk Assessment:**  While the skylights are constructed of polycarbonate material (not glass), they still represent a brittle plastic hazard. Potential contamination sources include:  - Fragments from impact damage or material fatigue  - Particles from UV degradation or weathering  - Debris accumulation on skylight surfaces that could dislodge  - Condensation drips that could carry surface contaminants  **Control Measures in Place:**   1. Skylights are registered on the Glass and Brittle Plastic Register (Form 5.8F1) 2. Monthly visual inspections conducted for integrity, cracks, or damage 3. Skylights constructed of shatter-resistant polycarbonate material rather than glass 4. Incident reporting procedure for any observed damage or deterioration  * Chemical Contamination:   + Potential for unintended migration of substances from the packaging material into food or other hygiene sensitive products.   + Chemical contamination risk from chiller bar leaking.   + Chemical contamination risk that may impact product safety of raw materials of finished goods at the Slitting Department   + Water contamination from cooling system is considered as it is a closed cycle and the water may come into contact with the product if leaking due to being broken.     - * + Planned Maintenance to prevent potential risk to Product Safety from any leaks at connections/fitting of pipes. * Quality:   + Defects critical to consumer safety   + Hazards that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use.   + Hazards that may impact quality of raw materials of finished goods of finished goods at the Slitting Department   + Potential for malicious   + Potential for fraud (e.g. substitution, adulteration or misrepresentation)   + Foreseeable misuse by the consumer.   + Potential for raw material fraud.   + Bright lights above machinery to ensure proper visuals of products taken place. – Lights are covered.   + Malfunctioning equipment was considered as a risk however there are checks in place at required frequency during production of the products to ensure that equipment that may pose a risk to product safety and quality if this equipment malfunctions are identified and rectified. Preventive measures include process control, a maintenance procedure & a control of non-conforming procedure. * These include:   + - * Condition of Sealer Bars       * Condition of Rubber Silicon Pads       * Condition of Teflon. * **Other Hazards and Information** :   + Potential problems arising from the use of with recycled materials content are not considered as recycled materials are not used.   + Legal criteria and Historical Hazards are addressed in the hazard categories depicted above.   + The allergens that were only considered is allergens that may be present in the machine maintenance lubricants & cleaning products however no allergen is present as stated in declaration from Suppliers.   + No Printing is done on site.   + Based on the Hazard Analysis and Risk assessment (HARA) performed below, no in-line testing and measuring equipment was deemed necessary for the manufacture of products, as manual quality checks are performed off line mitigating the quality and product safety risks.   + Subcontracting processes are not considered as there are no subcontracted processes.   **Starting point**:   * Supplier Approval   **End Point**:   * Customer Returns   **Process Control**  To ensure awareness of the potential for any aspect of the process to go out of control, and to have mitigating measures in place the following hazards are considered:  • Product quality defect  • Defects that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use.  • Defects which result in the production of products which are outside customer-specified quality parameters. | |

**CONCLUSION**:

Raw Material Flow: The raw material is stored in the warehouse, labelled, and covered with outer packaging. Slip sheets are used to prevent foreign bodies from contaminating the product. When practical, plastic pallets are utilised as much as possible. Raw Material that is “returned to stores” is covered with a blue liner, labelled with relevant traceability details, and stored back with other raw materials in the warehouse.

Drainage / Water Flow: There are no drains in the factory, only from ablutions to the outside. Any water that may spill onto the factory floor is cleaned up immediately as per the “Clean as you Go” Policy.

Water chiller units and water flow are closed systems. Maintenance is planned to prevent potential product safety risks from leaks at pipes, fittings, or connections.

Air Flow: The factory has no positive airflow, as all doors and windows are kept closed. However, “Whirly Birds” are situated on top of the roof for ventilation.

Finished Product Flow: When finished goods are packed from the production line into cartons, they are packed onto plastic pallets with slip sheets. Blue liners are utilised in the finished goods cartons to prevent contamination from chemicals, gas fumes from transport, pests, and/or dust. All finished goods are packed onto the finished goods shelving or palletised in the warehouse, ready for dispatch or storage.

WIP Flow: All WIP is palletised, covered where applicable, and stored in the warehouse. It is issued to production as and when needed. This WIP is identified with blue labels for easy segregation to prevent cross-contamination with finished goods.

People flow: People must stay in demarcated areas identified by yellow markings on the factory floor. Unauthorised access is restricted.

Employees entering the factory for the start and end of their shifts must sanitise, keep on the walkway, and go straight up to change rooms to change into their PPE. Contractors and visitors are handled by a responsible person, who issues PPE after reporting to reception.

Waste Flow: Set-up production waste is cleared from machines before start-up, weighed, recorded on Production Log Sheets, and segregated for destruction and disposal.

Trademark waste is weighed and documented on the **Trademarked Waste Destruction & Disposal Record**. The weight is recorded once the waste is destroyed, and the destroyed waste is disposed of. This disposal is then logged in the **Trademarked Waste Destruction & Disposal Record**. The baling process is adhered to.

Punch-outs (including Back Gusset Punches, Euro Slots, Tear Nicks, and Cropped Round Corners) are stored in designated blue bins on the factory floor to minimise the number of trips to the skip and reduce the risk of environmental pollution.
