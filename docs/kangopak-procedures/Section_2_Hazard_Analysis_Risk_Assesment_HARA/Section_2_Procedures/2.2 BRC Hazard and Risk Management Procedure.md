| 1. **OBJECTIVE**   To ensure a multidisciplinary Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team is in place to develop and manage the hazard and risk analysis system and ensure this is fully implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness.  To implement and maintain a formal Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system to ensure that all hazards to product safety, quality and legality are identified and appropriate controls established.   1. **METHOD**    1. **Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team**   A multi-disciplinary team possessing the necessary knowledge and experience in hazard and risk analysis is appointed to develop, review and manage the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system. This team is led by an appointed Team Leader. Refer to the **Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Team Appointment Letters**.  The Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team is responsible for the collection and evaluation of the technical data required for the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Study (HARA). All relevant information needed to conduct the hazard analysis is collected, maintained, updated and documented. Refer to the **HARA Study**  The hazard & risk team structure is documented in the **Organogram**. Refer **Organogram**  The hazard & risk team being a multifunctional team are all directly involved in process changes and are kept up to date with factory changes and customer requirements as they occur through informal discussions and/or email. Refer to **Process Control Procedure.**  Membership of the hazard & risk management team will be reviewed annually or following a change to a team member’s job description or a change in personnel affecting the hazard & risk management team.  The team members will sign appointment letters following the review detailing their individual responsibilities.   * 1. **Good Manufacturing Practises (GMPs)**   GMPs are established, implemented and maintained to assist in controlling the likelihood of;   * introducing product safety hazards to the product through the manufacturing, storage and distribution environment; * microbiological, chemical, foreign objects and allergen contamination of products, including cross contamination between products * defects critical to consumer safety * hazards that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use   These GMPs include but are not limited to the following elements:-   1.

Condition and age of the infrastructure element. 4. Potential failure modes, including breakage, deterioration, corrosion, or wear. 5. Environmental factors such as vibration, temperature changes, moisture, or UV exposure. Maintenance accessibility and frequency requirements. 6. Historical incidents or near misses involving building fabric.   **Documentation Requirements**   1. All identified building fabric hazards shall be recorded in the HARA risk assessment document. Appropriate risk ratings shall be assigned by considering likelihood multiplied by severity. Hazards must be linked to relevant control measures, for example, the Glass and Brittle Plastic Register for skylights. 2. They must also be subject to defined monitoring frequencies and included in verification activities during the annual HARA review.   **Example Assessment Entry**   1. **Hazard:** polycarbonate skylights above pouch making production line. 2. **Risk type:** physical contamination by foreign body. 3. **Potential source:** material degradation, impact damage, or UV deterioration of skylight panels. 4. **Current controls:** monthly inspection via the Glass and Brittle Plastic Register, shatter resistant material specification, preventive maintenance programme. 5. **Monitoring:** monthly visual inspection and annual condition assessment.   **Review Frequency**  Building infrastructure and fabric assessment shall be reviewed annually as part of the complete HARA review. It shall be updated whenever building modifications occur, re assessed following any infrastructure related incidents, and verified through physical walk-through inspections of the facility.  **Responsibility**  The HARA team shall lead this process in consultation with the Maintenance for technical specifications, the Production Manager for operational impact   * 1. **Hazard Risk Analysis**   A hazard risk analysis is conducted to determine, for each hazard, whether the elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe product.  The following is taken in to consideration for each hazard:   * The source of the hazards (whether it is present or introduced) * The probability / likelihood of occurrence * The nature of the hazard * The severity of the outcome by the hazard   Each hazard is evaluated according to the possible severity and the likelihood of their occurrence.   * + 1. **Qualitative Risk Rating Approach**   The Risk Rating (L / M / H/ E) is recorded on Hazard Analysis section in the HARA study to identify the significant hazards (i.e. those hazards that are reasonably likely to occur at an unacceptable level) which needed to be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels.   |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | The **Likelihood scale** of occurrence considering prerequisite programs in the absence of additional control: | | | | | **Rare** | | May occur only in exceptional circumstances. | | | **Unlikely** | | Could occur at some time. | | | **Possible** | | Might occur at some time/the event should occur at some time. | | | **Likely** | | Will probably occurs in most circumstances. | | | **Almost Certain** | | To occur in most circumstances | | | The **Severity/Magnitude** of the outcome (adverse health effects): | | | | | **Low** | Insignificant impact, little disruption to normal operations and/or not potential harm. | | | **Minor** | Some manageable operation disruption and/or no potential harm. | | | **Moderate** | Significant modification to normal operation but manageable, increased monitoring and/or potential to be harmful. | | | **Major** | Systems significantly compromised and abnormal operation, high level of monitoring required and/or potential to be harmful. | | | **Extreme** | Catastrophic impact, complete failure of systems and/or harmful. | |   The two scales are used in conjunction with the Risk Assessment Matrix below, to determine the hazard’s Risk Rating.  **Risk Assessment Matrix**   |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  | **Low (L)** | **Minor (Mi)** | **Moderate (Mo)** | **Major (Ma)** | **Extreme (E)** | | **Almost Certain (AC)** | High | High | Extreme | Extreme | Extreme | | **Likely (L)** | Medium | High | High | Extreme | Extreme | | **Possible (P)** | Low | Medium | High | Extreme | Extreme | | **Unlikely (U)** | Low | Low | Medium | High | Extreme | | **Rare (R’)** | Low | Low | Medium | High | High |  * + 1. **Risk Rating Explanation**  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | **Extreme risk (E):** Hazard is significant and must be reduced. |  |  | | **High risk (H):** Hazard is significant and must be reduced. |  |  | | **Medium Risk (M):** Hazard is Insignificant. Engineer out / administrative control. |  |  | | **Low risk (L):** Hazard is Insignificant.Low potential harm. The hazard must be managed. |  |  | |  | | |   Each hazard is assessed in terms of likelihood (L) and severity (S) to determine the relevant significance (Si).  The significance is determined as follows:  **Likelihood vs Severity = Significance (Risk Rating)**  Significant Risk:  Yes (Y): High / Extreme Risk Rating  No (N): Low / Medium Risk Rating   * 1. **Selection and assessment of control measures**   The Risk Rating is recorded on the Hazard Analysis section in the HARA study. In the event that the hazard is categorised as ‘Low’ or ‘Medium’, the Critical Control Measure (referred to as CCP) Decision Tree will not be followed because it is deemed not to be a significant hazard and could consequentially be controlled through the Pre-requisite Programmes.  If the significance rating is **High or Extreme**, the hazard is further analysed in terms of the CCP Decision Tree.  Based on the hazard assessment an appropriate combination of control measures are selected which can prevent, eliminating or reducing these hazards to defined acceptable levels. All the control measures are reviewed with respect to their effectiveness against the identified hazards.  Consideration may be given to using more than one control measure, including relevant prerequisites.  The selection and categorisation of the control measure is carried out using a logical approach that includes assessment about the following:   * its effect on identified hazards relative to the strictness applied. * the feasibility for monitoring (e.g. ability to be monitored in a timely manner to enable immediate corrections); * its position within the system relative to other control measures. * the likelihood of failure in the functioning of a control measure or significant processing variability. * the severity of the consequence in the case of failure in its functioning. * whether the control measure is specifically established and applied to eliminate or significantly reduce the level of hazards * any possible synergistic effects (i.e. interaction that occurs between two or more measures resulting in their combined effect being higher than the sum of their individual effects)   Control measures are implemented in accordance with the HARA Study and CCP Control chart.  CCP are control points that are required to prevent, eliminate or reduce a product safety or integrity hazard to acceptable levels.  Where elimination of hazard is not practical, justification for acceptable levels of the   * 1. **Establishing the CCP Control chart**   A **CCP Control chart** is developed for each identified CCP and contains the following information:   * Hazard to be controlled at the CCP * Control measure / preventive measure * Critical limits * Monitoring procedures * Corrections and corrective actions to be taken if critical limits are exceeded * Responsibilities and authorities * Records of monitoring   1. **Identification of Critical Limits**   To monitor the CCP, critical limits are defined to identify clearly if the process is in or out of control. Critical limits are measurable where possible and the rationale for their establishment clearly documented. Relevant legislation and codes of practice are considered when establishing the limits.  Critical limits based on subjective data (such as visual inspection of product, process, handling etc) are supported by clear guidance, instructions or specifications and training.   * 1. **Establish Monitoring System**   A monitoring system is established for each CCP to demonstrate that the CCP follow the critical limits. The system includes all scheduled measurements or observations relative to critical limits.  The monitoring procedure can detect loss of control of measures and where possible provide information in time for corrective action to be taken and consists of relevant procedures, instructions and records that cover the following:   * Measurements and observations that provide results within an adequate time frame * Monitoring devices used (e.g. online measurement, offline measurement or continuous measurement) * Applicable calibration methods * Monitoring frequency * Responsibility and authority related to monitoring and evaluation of monitoring results * Record requirements and methods (include the date, time and results of measurement, signed to responsible person)   The monitoring methods and frequency can determine when the critical limits have been exceeded in time for the product to be isolated before it is used.   * 1. **Actions when monitoring results exceed critical limits**   Planned corrective actions to be taken when critical limits are exceeded or where results indicate a trend towards loss of control are specified in the relevant Control Charts. The actions ensure that the non-conformity is identified, the parameters at the CCP are brought back under control and the recurrence is prevented. Responsibilities for monitoring the CCP and conducting Corrective Actions are also assigned.  Document procedures are established and maintained for the appropriate handling of potentially out-of-specification products to ensure that these products are not released until their safety is established. Document procedures are established and maintained for the appropriate handling of potentially out-of-specification products to ensure that these products are not released until their safety is established. Refer to Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure which includes any products that have been manufactured during the period when the activity was out of control, how control was regained and how potential recurrence is minimized.   * 1. **Updating of preliminary information and documents specifying the GMP’s and the CCP Control Charts**   After the CCP have been identified, the relevant documentation (Procedures / HARA studies / Work instruction) is updated accordingly.  **2.13.1 Validation of Control Measure Combinations**  **Validation Statement**  Verification procedures for the HARA plan have been established to confirm that controls, including those managed by prerequisite programmes, remain effective.  Activities such as internal audits, review of records where limits are exceeded, assessment of complaints and feedback, and review of product withdrawals or recalls are used to provide assurance of system performance.  Results of these verification activities are recorded and communicated to the HARA team as part of the continual review process.  Prior to implementation of control measures included in the CCP control plan, and after any change therein, we validate that: -   * The selected control measures can achieve the intended control of the hazards for which they are designed, including critical limits and * The control measures are effective and capable of, in combination, ensuring control of the identified hazards to obtain product that meet the defined acceptable levels.   The results are recorded in validation studies which includes documented evidence that show that the control measures selected, and critical limits identified are capable of consistently controlling the hazard to the specified acceptable level.  If the result of the validation shows that one or both above elements cannot be confirmed, the control measure and / or combinations thereof are modified and re-assessed.  Where equipment settings are critical to the safety of legality of the product, changes to the equipment settings are completed by trained and authorizes personnel.   * 1. **Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system review**   A review of the HARA studies is carried out at least once per year and following any significant incidents or when any process changes.  The Following Changes result in a review of the relevant HARA Study:   * Change in raw material or supplier of raw materials * Changes in product formulations/composition * Change in manufacturing conditions, process flow, manufacturing environment or equipment * Change to plant layout and environment * Change in packing material, storage or distribution conditions * Anticipated change in customer or consumer use * Trend in root cause and/or testing / analysis results * Emergence of a new risk * Results from verification activities * Internal and external audits * Review following incidents of product withdrawal or recall * New legislation or developments associated with raw materials, manufacturing or product * Change in cleaning programs * Failures in the system example Corrective actions and the need for product recall * Change in packaging, storage or distribution system * Receipt of info from the marketplace and indicating a health risk associated with the product * After commissioning of new machinery and within a two-month timeframe to allow time for simulation and updating of records to be completed upon completion of records and procedures.   The review includes a verification that the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system is effective and may include a review of:   * Complaints * Product failures * Recalls * Product withdrawals * Results of internal audits of prerequisite programmes * Results from external third-party auditors * New developments in industry associated with material, process or product. * Process changes * Product composition changes   1. **Record Keeping and Documentation**   Records and Documents are controlled as part of the Product Safety and Quality Management System.
