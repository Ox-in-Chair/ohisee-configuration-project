**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 11
**Revised Date:** 2025-05-29
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Purpose

To ensure a multidisciplinary Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team is in place to develop and manage the hazard and risk analysis system and ensure this is fully implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness.

To implement and maintain a formal Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system to ensure that all hazards to product safety, quality and legality are identified and appropriate controls established.

## Method

### Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Team

A multi-disciplinary team possessing the necessary knowledge and experience in hazard and risk analysis is appointed to develop, review and manage the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment system. This team is led by an appointed Team Leader. Refer to the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Team Appointment Letters.

The Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team is responsible for the collection and evaluation of the technical data required for the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Study (HARA). All relevant information needed to conduct the hazard analysis is collected, maintained, updated and documented. Refer to the HARA Study

The hazard & risk team structure is documented in the Organogram.

The hazard & risk team being a multifunctional team are all directly involved in process changes and are kept up to date with factory changes and customer requirements as they occur through informal discussions and/or email. Refer to Process Control Procedure.

Membership of the hazard & risk management team will be reviewed annually or following a change to a team member's job description or a change in personnel affecting the hazard & risk management team. The team members will sign appointment letters following the review detailing their individual responsibilities.

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)

GMPs are established, implemented and maintained to assist in controlling the likelihood of:

- Introducing product safety hazards to the product through the manufacturing, storage and distribution environment
- Microbiological, chemical, foreign objects and allergen contamination of products, including cross contamination between products
- Defects critical to consumer safety
- Hazards that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use

These GMPs include but are not limited to the following elements:

- Site Standards
- Process Control
- Housekeeping and Cleaning
- Pest Control
- Personal Hygiene
- Transport, Storage and distribution
- Training and Competence
- Senior Management Commitment & Continual Improvements
- Internal audits
- Traceability
- Corrective and Preventative Actions
- Specifications

### Design HARA

When a new product that does not form part of an existing HARA study is being developed, a new HARA study is started as part of the Product Design and Development Procedure.

This study ensures that the hazards related to the product and processes have been identified and their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels validated to produce a safe product.

If an extension of existing product range is developed, the current HARA study is reviewed and changes are implemented accordingly.

If changes are made on current products, the current HARA study is reviewed and changes are implemented accordingly.

## Hazard and Risk Methodology

### Terms of Reference / Scope of Study

The scope of the hazards and risk analysis is clearly defined and cover all products and processes included within the intended scope of certification.

This includes:

- Product and/or Process
- Hazards to be considered
- Starting point (Commencement of Control)
- End Point (End of control)

When conducting the hazard analysis risk assessment, the hazard & risk team takes into account:

- Historical and known hazards associated with specific processes, raw materials and finished products
- Legislation relevant to the manufacturing and sale of finished product
- Customer requirements
- Map of the premises and equipment layout
- Intended use of the product (where known)
- Allergen containing raw material
- Copy of existing site HARA plan
- Conditions for storage, method of transport and distribution
- Packing materials used for the protection of the finished product
- Known likely product defects that affect product quality and safety
- Codex Alimentarius
- Foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectant Act, 1972
- SANS 241 Drinking Water
- SANS 10049 Food Safety Management - Requirements for GMP's
- SANS 10330:2001 Requirements for a Hazard Analysis and critical control point system
- Relevant FDA and EU regulations

Changes in regulations and legislation are monitored through email subscriptions and notifications and reviewed at management review meetings.

### Product Description

A full description of the product is developed, which includes all relevant information on product safety, quality and legality, to assist in identifying possible hazards as appropriate, including:

- Composition, e.g., raw materials, inks, varnishes, additives, coatings and other print chemicals
- Origin of raw material including use of recycled materials
- Treatments and processes undertaken
- Intended use of the finished product and defined restrictions on use, for instance, direct food contact or other hygiene-sensitive products
- Functional Properties
- Storage conditions and expected usable life of the finished product

### Site Schematic, Process Flow Diagrams, Process Steps and Control Measures

**Site Schematic & Flow Diagram:**

- The Site Schematic is a floor plan detailing the segregated areas (production lines, storage areas, personnel facilities etc)
- Water Flow is indicated on the Flow Diagram
- The Flow Diagram indicates all possible areas of cross contamination by raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, and waste streams and personnel routes

**Process Flow Diagram:**
A process flow diagram is prepared for each product, product group or process. This include each process step from the receipt of raw materials to despatch to the customer.

The process flow diagrams include:

- Receipt and approval of artwork and specification
- Receipt and preparation of raw materials such as additives, inks and adhesives
- Each step of the manufacturing process or work in progress retention stage
- The sequence and interaction of each manufacturing process step
- Introduction of utilities and other contact materials (e.g. air, water and packing materials)
- Outsourced processes
- In-line testing or measuring equipment
- The use of rework and recycled materials
- Waste
- Finished product storage and distribution
- Any subcontracted operations
- Customer returns or materials to be returned to the supplier

**On-site Verification:**
The Site Schematic, Flow Diagram and Process Flow Diagram are verified on site for accuracy and completeness and approved by the Hazard and risk team. This is done annually and whenever there are changes, by following the actual process flow diagram in relevant areas in site. Records of verification is maintained.

### Hazard Analysis

The hazard & risk team shall identify and record all potential hazards that are reasonably expected to occur with incoming material and at each manufacturing step-in relation to the product and process. The hazards considered include:

- Microbiological
- Physical
- Chemical contamination (e.g. taint, odour, allergen, component transfer from inks varnishes and glues)
- Potential issues arising from the use of recycled materials
- Legality
- Defects critical to consumer safety
- Hazards that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use
- Potential for unintended migration of substances from the packaging material into food or other hygiene sensitive products
- Potential for malicious intervention
- Foreseeable unintended use by the customer or consumer
- Potential for raw material fraud (e.g. substitution, adulteration or misrepresentation)

In addition to ensure awareness of the potential for any aspect of the process to go out of control, and to have mitigating measures in place the following hazards are considered:

- Product quality defect
- Defects that may have an impact on the functional integrity and performance of the final product in use
- Defects which result in the production of products which are outside customer-specified quality parameters
- Limitations of the use of the product
- Allergen contamination risks

## Critical Control Points (CCPs)

### CCP Control Chart

A CCP Control chart is developed for each identified CCP and contains:

- Hazard to be controlled at the CCP
- Control measure / preventive measure
- Critical limits
- Monitoring procedures
- Corrections and corrective actions to be taken if critical limits are exceeded
- Responsibilities and authorities
- Records of monitoring

### Critical Limits

Critical limits are defined to identify clearly if the process is in or out of control. Critical limits are measurable where possible and the rationale for their establishment clearly documented. Relevant legislation and codes of practice are considered when establishing the limits.

Critical limits based on subjective data (such as visual inspection of product, process, handling etc) are supported by clear guidance, instructions or specifications and training.

### Monitoring System

A monitoring system is established for each CCP to demonstrate that the CCP follow the critical limits. The system includes all scheduled measurements or observations relative to critical limits.

The monitoring procedure consists of:

- Measurements and observations that provide results within an adequate time frame
- Monitoring devices used (e.g. online measurement, offline measurement or continuous measurement)
- Applicable calibration methods
- Monitoring frequency
- Responsibility and authority related to monitoring and evaluation of monitoring results
- Record requirements and methods

### Corrective Actions

Planned corrective actions to be taken when critical limits are exceeded are specified in the relevant Control Charts. The actions ensure that the non-conformity is identified, the parameters at the CCP are brought back under control and the recurrence is prevented.

## Validation and Verification

### Validation of Control Measures

Prior to implementation of control measures included in the CCP control plan, validation confirms that:

- The selected control measures can achieve the intended control of the hazards for which they are designed
- The control measures are effective and capable of, in combination, ensuring control of the identified hazards

### Verification Activities

Verification procedures for the HARA plan confirm that controls, including those managed by prerequisite programmes, remain effective. Activities include:

- Internal audits
- Review of records where limits are exceeded
- Assessment of complaints and feedback
- Review of product withdrawals or recalls

## HARA System Review

A review of the HARA studies is carried out at least once per year and following any significant incidents or when any process changes occur.

Changes that result in a review include:

- Change in raw material or supplier of raw materials
- Changes in product formulations/composition
- Change in manufacturing conditions, process flow, manufacturing environment or equipment
- Change to plant layout and environment
- Change in packing material, storage or distribution conditions
- Anticipated change in customer or consumer use
- Results from verification activities
- Internal and external audits
- New legislation or developments
- After commissioning of new machinery
