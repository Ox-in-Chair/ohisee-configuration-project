# Procedure 5.8: Foreign Body Contamination Control

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 22
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Systems Co-Ordinator
**Status:** Current

---

## OBJECTIVE

Ensure all practical steps are taken to identify, eliminate, avoid, or minimise the risk of contamination of glass, brittle plastic, blade, or any other foreign body.

## METHOD

### Training

All staff working in the production facility and with sharps are trained to avoid and detect foreign bodies.

### Definition of Brittleness

**Brittle materials** are defined as those that are hard but prone to breaking or shattering easily under stress, producing sharp fragments. Unlike hard plastic, which may bend or deform before breaking, brittle materials fracture suddenly without significant deformation.

**Material Types:**
Common brittle materials include glass, ceramics, some plastics (like acrylic or polycarbonate), and certain metals. All items made from these materials within the facility must be identified.

**Identification Criteria:**

- **Hardness:** Evaluate whether the material resists deformation under applied stress
- **Fracture Behaviour:** Assess whether the material exhibits sudden breaking with sharp edges or fragments rather than bending or deforming
- **Stress Test:** When uncertain, apply a force to the material. Brittle materials will crack or break with minimal deformation

**Classification Examples:**

*Correct Classification:*

- Glass items: windows, light bulbs, thermometers
- Ceramic items: tiles, insulators, plates
- Brittle plastics: acrylic panels, polycarbonate guards, and hard plastic handles

*Incorrect Classification:*

- Hard but non-brittle plastics: HDPE containers, rubberised components, and flexible PVC, which may deform but not shatter

### Glass and Brittle Plastic Register

The production facility does not use unnecessary non-production glass, ceramics, or brittle plastics that may pose a risk of contamination.

All glass and brittle plastic used in the production facility are registered, indicating their location on a glass and brittle plastics register.

The Glass and Brittle Plastic register includes the following:

- A list of items detailing location number, type & condition
- Recorded checks of the condition of items, carried out at a specified frequency based on a level of risk
- Details on cleaning or replacing items to minimise the potential for product contamination

### Glass protection

All bulbs and strip lights in the production facility, including those on flying insect control devices (food-grade protected), are protected.

### Glass and Brittle Plastic Condition Monitoring

Inspections are done using the Glass and Brittle plastics register to inspect all glass & brittle plastic. The frequency of inspections is determined based on the risk assessment.

Based on risk, glass and brittle plastics not in the production or storage areas shall be included in the register.

The system's coordinator inspects the factory and warehousing. The administration manager verifies this inspection.

Any defective or missing items that do not pose a risk must be corrected in the month preceding the inspection before the next inspection takes place.

The setter operators, operators, and packers inspect the machinery and equipment at the required frequency per each machine's Glass and Brittle Plastic Register. The Team Leader of the relevant department verifies this inspection.

Suppose any items in the glass or brittle plastic registers are damaged or missing. In that case, the inspection person must complete a maintenance job card and hand it in with the register. Maintenance is planned at the time of verification. The maintenance job card register is completed to ensure timely close out per the maintenance procedure.

**Spectacles:**
All production staff who require and wear spectacles will be listed on the Spectacles Glass & Brittle Register.

These spectacles will be inspected at the required frequency, based on risk, as per the Spectacles Glass & Brittle Register.

Any incidences of missing, cracked, or broken fixtures are actioned immediately for a replacement that may pose a quality or safety risk to the product.

### Glass and Brittle Plastic Breakage Reporting

In the event of accidental breakage of any glass or brittle plastic, including windows, the Handling Of Glass Breakage Work Instruction is adhered to to ensure that no other area can become contaminated due to the breakage. Any product that has become contaminated is segregated and disposed of.

An NCA is completed to report any incident of breakages.

### Sharps Policy

Refer to the Product Safety and Quality Management policy manual for sharps policy. This policy is applicable to manufacturing, storage and ancillary areas such as the workshop.

**Control the use of Sharp cutting instruments, equipment & loose tools.**

A defined quantity of sharp knives, blades, and instruments used in the factory are stored at reception.

All blades are issued as requested by production and recorded on the Blades and Knife Register. The Systems Co-Ordinator controls this.

Production personnel request new blades from the Systems Co-Ordinator.

The Systems Co-Ordinator ensures that "new" blades are only issued in exchange for "used" blades.

The register is completed with the number of used blades returned and new blades issued and signed by both production personnel and the Systems Coordinator.

Outside of admin hours, blades are made available to the Team Leader in a designated container, the register is signed, and the Systems Co-Ordinator performs a reconciliation of issued vs. returned the following morning to ensure Sharps control.

If the reconciliation indicates missing blades, a Non-Conformance is raised, and the Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure must be followed.

The exchange of "used" blades for "new" blades is performed in the admin offices during regular working hours.

The Blade & Knife Register and the blades will not be taken into the production area.

All blades are disposed of in the blade canister. Old blades are collected by a Medical Waste Company and destroyed. A Safe Disposal Certificate is received.

Per the Sharps Policy, the production facility does not use snap-off blades.

Employees' knives and Allen keys are stored in plastic containers at the end of each machine when on shift. At the end of the shift, employees will store their knives and Allen keys in their designated PPE locker along with all items issued by Kangopak (Conti Suits, Safety Boots, Shirts, and Safety Glasses). These items are not to be stored in personal lockers.

Any identified loose blades are discarded immediately and recorded on a Non-Conformance Advice.

No sharp objects or loose tools are left on machinery or equipment.

All loose tools are kept on the shadow board in the production area when not in use.

All equipment is stored on the racking in the storage area where contamination won't occur.

All notice boards in production and storage areas have no loose fastenings, such as drawing pins and staples present. Prestik is used to stick notices up for display.

### Packing/Sorting Tables

Packing tables are kept free of foreign objects to prevent product contamination. This is done through daily cleaning per the Cleaning Schedule and weekly maintenance checks per the Maintenance Plan.

### Capping of Spouts

Tables, where the capping of spouts is kept free of foreign objects to prevent product contamination, are done as per the Work Instruction for Spout Inserting.

Spouts or Caps that fall onto the floor are discarded by the "capper" as per WI.

Capped spouts are put into a carton with a blue line to prevent contamination.

### Temporary Modifications to Machinery and Equipment

Temporary modifications are made to enable the machinery and equipment to run effectively.

If these modifications pose a risk of product contamination, they are recorded and checked according to the process control checks on the Production Log Sheet. This is done for every job and, if applicable, at every shift changeover.

These temporary modifications are monitored during GMP Activity Audit at the required frequency to ensure compliance.

### Repairs / Breakdowns / Corrective Maintenance

Maintenance is carried out so that production on adjoining lines or equipment is not at risk of contamination by a skilled or qualified person.

Clean as You Go Policy is adhered to throughout any maintenance being performed.

### Post-Maintenance Cleaning

Before maintained equipment/machinery is released to production, the team leader, operator, and packer clean and inspect it before use. This is recorded on the Maintenance job cards being completed.

After use, employees clear away tools and other maintenance equipment and store them in designated areas, such as Lin Bins, Shadow Board, and Workshop.

Any lost bolts, washers, screws, ferrules, lugs etc. must be accounted for and cleared up, put away in a designated area or discarded, if broken, at all times.

Production can only commence after the completion of the Post-Hygiene Clearance and the closing of the job card to reduce the risk of foreign body contamination.
