## What Is an Incident?

An incident is any event that could affect the safety, legality, or quality of our packaging products. This includes contamination, foreign objects, incorrect specifications, or anything that could harm consumers or fail to meet legal requirements.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (3.14.1):** Sites must have documented incident management procedure including product recall/withdrawal.

**Kangopak Requirement:** All Risk Team personnel are trained in this procedure annually or when updated. The procedure is tested annually.

## Types of Incidents Requiring Action

### Immediate Action Required
- **Foreign body contamination:** Metal, glass, plastic fragments in packaging
- **Chemical contamination:** Cleaning chemicals, lubricants, or inks on packaging surfaces
- **Microbiological risk:** Potential for harmful bacteria growth
- **Allergen cross-contact:** Allergen residue where it shouldn't be
- **Specification failure:** Packaging doesn't meet customer product safety requirements

### Assessment Needed
- **Minor quality defects:** Colour variations, minor print issues
- **Equipment malfunctions:** That might have affected product safety
- **Supplier notifications:** Problems with raw materials we've used
- **Customer complaints:** About product safety or quality

## The Incident Management Process

### Step 1: Immediate Response (Within 2 hours)
1. **STOP production** of affected product immediately
2. **Secure the product** - isolate and quarantine all potentially affected stock
3. **Notify Risk Team Leader** - contact details on emergency board
4. **Document everything** - time, nature of incident, products affected, quantities

### Step 2: Risk Assessment (Within 4 hours)
1. **Assess the risk** - could this harm consumers?
2. **Determine scope** - how much product might be affected?
3. **Check traceability** - where has affected product gone?
4. **Decision point** - withdrawal needed or incident contained?

### Step 3: Customer Notification (Within 24 hours if withdrawal required)
1. **Contact customers** who received affected product
2. **Provide clear information** about the problem and action needed
3. **Request confirmation** of product location and withdrawal action
4. **Document all communications** with timestamps

### Step 4: Authority Notification (If required)
1. **Notify relevant authorities** - local council, [To Be Confirmed: South African Equivalent Required]
2. **Provide required information** about the incident and actions taken
3. **Cooperate fully** with any investigation
4. **Maintain records** of all authority communications

## Key Roles in Incident Management

### Risk Team Leader
- **Decision maker** for withdrawal actions
- **Primary contact** with customers and authorities
- **Coordinates** all incident response activities

### Production Manager
- **Stops production** when incident identified
- **Secures affected products** in quarantine area
- **Provides technical information** about the incident

### Quality Manager
- **Assesses product safety risk** of the incident
- **Reviews traceability records** to determine scope
- **Interfaces with laboratories** for testing if needed

### Your Role (All Personnel)
- **Report incidents immediately** - don't wait or hope it will be okay
- **Follow instructions** from Risk Team members
- **Maintain confidentiality** - don't discuss incidents outside work
- **Support investigation** by providing accurate information

## Practical Factory Examples

### DO's ✓
- **Spot a metal fragment:** Stop machine immediately, call Risk Team, secure all product from that production run
- **Customer complaint:** Log all details, don't promise anything, refer to Quality Manager immediately
- **Equipment breakdown:** Assess if it could have affected product safety, report if uncertain
- **Documentation:** Write down exactly what you observed, when, and what actions you took

### DON'Ts ✗
- **Never** continue production if you suspect a safety problem
- **Never** try to "fix" problems by sorting out defective product
- **Never** contact customers directly about incidents
- **Never** assume small problems don't matter
- **Never** discuss incidents with unauthorised personnel or on social media

## Communication During Incidents

### Internal Communication
- **Be factual** - stick to what you know, not what you think
- **Be prompt** - report immediately, don't wait for breaks
- **Be clear** - describe exactly what you saw or found
- **Be available** - you may be needed to provide more information

### Customer Communication (Risk Team only)
- **Professional tone** - calm, concerned, but confident in our response
- **Clear information** - what happened, what we're doing, what they need to do
- **Regular updates** - keep customers informed of progress
- **Written confirmation** - follow up phone calls with emails

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **You find a small piece of metal in packaging material. What are your first three actions?**
   - Answer: Stop production immediately, secure all potentially affected product, notify Risk Team Leader

2. **How quickly must customers be notified if a product withdrawal is required?**
   - Answer: Within 24 hours of the decision to withdraw

3. **Who is responsible for deciding whether a product withdrawal is necessary?**
   - Answer: Risk Team Leader, based on risk assessment by the Risk Team

## Simple Practical Activity (10 minutes)

**Incident Reporting Simulation:**

1. **Scenario presented:** Trainer describes a potential incident (e.g., cleaning chemical spill near packaging)
2. **Individual response:** Each participant writes down their immediate actions
3. **Group discussion:** Compare responses and identify best practices
4. **Role play:** Practice reporting the incident to Risk Team Leader
5. **Review procedure:** Check actions against written procedure document

## What Supervisors Look For

Your supervisor will assess:

- **Response time:** How quickly you report potential incidents
- **Decision making:** Your ability to recognise when to stop production
- **Communication:** Clear, accurate reporting of incident details
- **Procedure knowledge:** Following documented steps in correct order
- **Record keeping:** Accurate documentation of your actions and observations
- **Confidentiality:** Appropriate discretion about incident information

**Testing:** This procedure is tested annually through simulation exercises.
