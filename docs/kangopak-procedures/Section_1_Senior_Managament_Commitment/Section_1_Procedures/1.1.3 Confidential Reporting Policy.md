**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 1
**Revised Date:** 2025-08-07
**Document Owner:** Director
**Status:** Current

## Purpose

Kangopak maintains the highest food/product safety standards, quality, legality, and ethical integrity. To uphold these principles, this Confidential Reporting System (Whistleblower Policy) provides employees with a secure and anonymous way to report concerns without fear of retaliation. This policy ensures compliance with Packaging Standards and other relevant regulatory requirements.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and stakeholders within Kangopak. It covers reporting of concerns related to:

- Product safety, quality, authenticity, and legality
- Workplace misconduct, fraud, or unethical behaviour
- Health and safety hazards
- Harassment, discrimination, or other violations of company policies

## Responsibilities & Oversight

### Senior Management Responsibilities

- Ensure the Confidential Reporting System is accessible, well-communicated, and secure
- Investigate reports fairly and take timely corrective action
- Monitor and review the effectiveness of the reporting system

### Employee Responsibilities

- Report concerns honestly and in good faith
- Use the system responsibly and not for personal disputes
- Cooperate in investigations when necessary

## Confidential Reporting System Overview

### How the System Works

Employees can report concerns through one of the following confidential channels:

**Physical Confidential Reporting Boxes:**

- Secure, locked boxes are strategically placed in low-surveillance areas (e.g., break rooms, locker rooms, restrooms)
- Employees can submit written reports without including their name
- The process for collecting, reviewing, and escalating reports is clearly defined to enhance the confidential reporting system

**Collection Process:**

- The designated collector (specifically the Admin Manager) will collect physical reports from the secure lock boxes in the ladies' and men's change rooms
- This establishes a clear segregation of duties, which is vital to prevent potential bias or cover-ups, primarily if reports concern senior management
- Having segregation for the collection of the reports ensures objectivity and maintains the integrity of the reporting system
- After collection, the collector will read, correlate, scan, and send the reviewed reports to senior management (specifically the Operations Manager) for further review and escalation
- Reports are reviewed weekly by the designated compliance team after collection and initial processing

### What Happens After a Report is Submitted?

- The designated senior management compliance officer will review reports within one week of receipt from the suggestion boxes
- This strict timeframe ensures prompt attention to concerns and addresses past oversights where reports were left unchecked
- If necessary, an internal investigation is conducted
- Corrective actions are taken, and systemic improvements are implemented
- The reporting system is monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure effectiveness

## Protection of Whistleblowers

### Anonymity & Confidentiality

- Employees are not required to disclose their identity when submitting a report
- Reports are handled discreetly and securely to protect the whistleblower
- Investigations are conducted in private meetings without exposing the source of the complaint

### No Retaliation Policy

- Retaliation against employees who report concerns in good faith is strictly prohibited
- Any employee or manager found retaliating against a whistleblower will face disciplinary action, up to and including termination

## Preventing Bad Faith Reports

While this system is designed to encourage employees to report concerns, it must not be misused for false accusations, personal conflicts, or revenge.

### What is a Bad Faith Report?

A bad-faith report is a complaint submitted with dishonest intent, including:

- False allegations to harm a colleague or manager
- Reports based on personal conflicts rather than real workplace concerns
- Repeated unfounded complaints intended to manipulate the system
- Using the system to avoid personal responsibility

### Consequences of False Reports

Kangopak is committed to preventing bad-faith reports and ensuring that the provisions for addressing such reports are clearly stated and reinforced. While the system protects whistleblowers who report in good faith, it is crucial that it is not misused for false accusations, personal conflicts, or revenge.

Employees who knowingly submit false reports may face:

- Formal warning or reprimand
- Suspension or dismissal, depending on the severity
- Legal consequences if the report causes reputational or financial harm

Kangopak is committed to ensuring every report is made in good faith to help build a safer and more ethical workplace.
