# Procedure 1.1.1: Product Safety Culture Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 0

## Purpose

The extent to which all employees internalise and apply consistent product safety behaviours is influenced by their own cultures, attitudes, values and beliefs, and training effectiveness, as well as those of their peers and their business. Managing behaviours within the workplace will reinforce and ensure the safety of the food being grown, transported, manufactured, or served. Lack of engagement is cited as one reason employees do not consistently follow product safety protocols. The purpose of this document is to describe the document, define and maintain a clear plan for the development and continuing improvement of a product safety and quality culture.

## Method

In order to expect consistent employee behaviours as the norm activities have been defined for a clear plan to develop and continue a product safety and quality culture. The development of the plan takes into account the following key drivers:

- Business Structure, Values and Purpose
- Senior Managers and Leaders
- Trust and Openness
- Hazard and Risk awareness
- Communication and Messaging

### 6.1.1 WHAT 1: Business Structure, Values and Purpose

The Vision and Mission are established by the senior leadership team. Strategic objectives product safety and quality, the importance is reflected in the company's communications.
Similarly, a company's core values transcend all aspects of the business.
Defined activities:
Incorporate Product safety into the company values as core to the business and integral in its direction-setting
Align product safety policy statement to place product safety requirements in alignment with the company's strategic direction.
Pro-food-safety communications from senior leadership affirm true top-down engagement. Communication and Training on Updated Product safety and Quality Policy: Create a trusting and open environment that empowers employees to speak up if they feel that product safety is being compromised
Set and measure Product safety and Quality Objectives
Tools and Equipment (Resource Management): Provide suitable clothing, equipment, premises and buildings.

### 6.1.2 WHAT 2: Senior Leaders and Managers

These individuals need to show their clear and consistent commitment to making safe products, which includes dedicating time and effort to train and educate staff, and ensure that all people involved in food production (e.g., staff, contractors) realise that they play a part in product safety and that they are accountable. Defined activities:
Training: Product safety Culture, Employee Responsibility and Accountability, Product safety Awareness, Work Instructions
Training: Employees should understand that they are accountable and responsible for ensuring food is safe; they should know the risks and the right thing to do as a matter of course at all times. They should not be able to get away with unacceptable behaviours.
Training: Employee awareness of the need to report any evidence of unsafe or out-of-specification product or raw material, to a designated manager to enable the resolution of issues requiring immediate action.

### WHAT 3: Hazard and Risk Awareness

All relevant hazards and risks that might have a product safety impact on the business and this is communicated to staff in an effective manner, with regular updates. Education can create a sense of shared responsibility enterprise-wide, and help to engage both hearts and minds. Everyone has a role, and recognising potential hazards is as important at the senior executive level as it is for line workers. Defined activities:

- Ensure employees understand the hazards associated with their duties, establishing a uniform base-level comprehension of hazards and risks, a goal best achieved through employee education.
- Make basic scientific and technical information accessible and understandable to everyone.
- Ensure everyone must understand "why we do things" to promote trust that the right decisions are being made relative to policies, procedures, and the proper investment of financial and human capital.
- Each employee and department should understand their respective product safety-related responsibilities.
- Operators responsible key processes and certain pre-requisite programmes: sanitation, foreign body control and allergen management.

### 6.1.5 WHAT 5: Communications and Messaging

Good communication ensures that a company's product safety strategy and expectations are received consistently and understood by all employees within the organisation. The goal is to educate, inform, and raise awareness among all new and existing employees of safe practices so they assume ownership of their role in ensuring consumer safety and brand protection. Defined activities:

- Display Product safety and Quality Posters
- Tasks to perform and the SOPs to follow are documented to be as simple and easy as possible, and the amount of effort and time required to execute them are optimised.
- Review use of pictures rather than text for instructions or specifications.

### 6.2.1 HOW 1: People Empowerment

The extent to which people within a business have both the knowledge and authority to act will impact that organisation's ability to adapt, improve and sustain its product safety culture. Employees at all levels should have the power to lead or initiate positive change.

### 6.2.2 HOW 2: Expectations

Employees should understand that they are accountable and responsible for ensuring food is safe; they should know the risks and the right thing to do as a matter of course at all times. They should not be able to get away with unacceptable behaviours.
This should be achieved via training and education but possibly also reinforced by an effective reward system.

### 6.2.3 HOW 3: Decision Making

An independent escalation path that allows the product safety team and staff to report directly to senior leadership rather than senior operations staff, so that product safety is not compromised when the production and/or commercial teams are under pressure and "cutting corners" is on the table and in conflict with business objectives.
Employee Feedback on why things work/don't work: Companies intent on enhancing their product safety culture understand the value in actively soliciting routine employee feedback to ensure the employees have the ability and the tools necessary to execute the appropriate product safety behaviours.

### 6.1.10 HOW 4: Competency/Training

How do you define the knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviours that workers need to perform their product safety roles effectively? How do you know if they are qualified and competent for the job/task?
Training is essential to ensure that the employee is competent. It includes a range of learning opportunities, such as education, experience/on the job, coaching and mentoring, networking, workshops and conferences, job shadowing, and standardisation. Training is conducted as described in the Training procedure.

### 6.1.12 How 5: Reinforcement

Reinforcement relates to the use of rewards, incentives, and disincentives to shape and manage correct behaviours. Rewards, when paired with fair and transparent recognition programs, can help management guide desired product safety behaviours. Such programs should be designed to accommodate cultural differences and different personalities within the organisation. Clear accountability and compliance foster commitment, empowerment, and ownership. Examples of reinforcements are:

- Positive and negative feedback
- Learnings from failures
- Monetary and time compensation, praise
- Incentives to report failures and near misses
- Promotion and demotion

## Measurement of Effectiveness of Product Safety and Quality Culture Plan

The action plan indicating how the activities will be undertaken and measured, against intended timescales are documented in Product safety and Quality Culture Plan.
Other key performance indicators used such as measures against strategic objectives and measures against product safety and quality objectives are incorporated into the plan.

Measurement for each activity will be done as follows:

Planned/Uninitiated = 0 Initiated = 1
Implemented = 2 Effective = 3

This scale will subsequently be used to calculate an overall percentage measure of Product safety and Quality Culture at Kangopak.

### Method of Determining Effectiveness

1 Mark is given for every correct and
Workers completed questionnaire. 1 Mark is given for every correct answer.
Product safety team calculate workers product safety culture awareness score %
Product safety team calculate average % of all workers every 6 months
Product safety report % increase of culture.
Management takes appropriate actions if effectiveness of culture decrease.

## Records

The review of effectiveness is done quarterly and collated and reported to top management at annual management review as per Management Review Procedure.
