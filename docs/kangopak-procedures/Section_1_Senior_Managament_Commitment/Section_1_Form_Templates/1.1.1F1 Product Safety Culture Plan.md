| Pillar | Activity | Responsibility | Frequency | KPI / Score (1–3) | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| Communication | Share product safety information regularly through established channels (e.g. WhatsApp group, noticeboards, briefings) so all employees receive and understand key messages as defined in 1.2 Communication Procedure. | Operations Manager | 10 times Per annum | 1 = Messages irregular or little engagement\n\n2 = Regular messages, partial engagement\n\n3 = Regular messages, high engagement and interaction | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| Training | Provide annual food safety training for all staff, ensure new employees are trained at induction, and confirm competence through refresher sessions or practical checks as defined in 6.1 Training and Competence Procedure. | Operations Manager/Director | Annual | 1 = Planned / Minimal /Little or no verification of competency.\n\n2 = Implemented / Partial/Competency checks done but not consistent across all staff.\n\n3 = Effective / Embedded/Competency checks confirm staff can apply knowledge. | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| Feedback | Collect employee feedback on product safety through surveys or direct reporting, and ensure responses are reviewed, acted upon, and communicated back to staff as defined in 1.1.1. Product Safety Culture Procedure. | Operations Manager/Director | Annual | 1 = Responses show inconsistent leadership commitment, weak communication, or lack of empowerment.Culture is still mostly compliance-driven (people do the minimum, often only when observed).\n\n2 = Employees generally understand their role, training is mostly effective, and some proactive behaviours are visible. Feedback mechanisms exist, but impact is uneven (e.g. some actions from feedback, but not consistently).\n\n3 = Leadership visibly prioritizes safety, communication is open, and employees feel empowered.Proactive reporting, accountability, and continuous learning are normalised behaviours | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| Behaviours | Define and communicate expected food safety behaviours, with managers reinforcing them through daily leadership so staff apply them consistently without supervision. | Operations Manager/Director | Annual & Ongoing | 1 = Behaviours defined but not widely visible or reinforced. \nStaff mostly comply when supervised; lapses when not observed.\n\n2 = Behaviours are communicated and partially adopted across teams.Most staff follow safety practices, but not always without prompting.Supervisors occasionally reinforce behaviours, but not systematically.\n\n3 = Behaviours are widely demonstrated without supervision. Strong culture of proactive reporting, accountability, and empowerment.\nStaff consistently adhere to protocols and encourage peers. | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| Performance Measurement | The site will track and review KPIs on product safety, legality, and quality (e.g. complaints, audit findings, incidents, compliance checks) at set intervals to monitor culture and drive improvement as defined by Management Review. | Senior Leadership | Annual | 1 = Key metrics (complaints, audit NCs, incidents, legal compliance) are not consistently tracked or reviewed. Little or no evidence that performance data drives improvement.\n\n2 = Metrics are tracked regularly (monthly/quarterly) and reported to management. Evidence of progress in some areas (e.g. fewer NCs), but not across all.\n\n3 = Metrics on safety, legality, and quality are systematically tracked and reviewed. Results show continuous improvement trends (e.g. fewer complaints, stronger audit outcomes, full compliance). | NaN | NaN | NaN |
