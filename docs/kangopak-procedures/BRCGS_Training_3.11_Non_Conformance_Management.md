## Why Non-Conformance Management Matters

Non-conforming materials are products or raw materials that don't meet their specifications. Using these materials can lead to unsafe packaging, customer complaints, product recalls, and loss of certification. Proper management protects our customers and maintains our reputation.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**

- 3.11.1: Procedures for control of out-of-specification materials must be in place
- 3.11.2: Materials must be assessed and decisions documented

**Kangopak Standard:** All non-conforming materials must be immediately segregated, assessed by competent personnel, and properly dispositioned with full documentation.

## Understanding Non-Conformance (BRCGS 3.11.1)

### What Are Non-Conforming Materials?

Materials that fail to meet their agreed specifications:

**Raw materials:**

- **Incorrect dimensions** - thickness, width, length outside tolerances
- **Wrong material properties** - incorrect strength, transparency, or barrier properties
- **Contamination** - foreign matter, odours, or discoloration
- **Packaging defects** - damaged packaging allowing contamination
- **Documentation issues** - missing certificates, incorrect labelling

**Finished products:**

- **Dimensional failures** - sizes outside customer specifications
- **Print defects** - wrong colours, missing text, poor registration
- **Functional failures** - sealing problems, barrier failures
- **Appearance defects** - scratches, marks, or distortion
- **Contamination** - foreign bodies or chemical contamination

**Process outputs:**

- **Out-of-specification parameters** - temperature, pressure, speed variations
- **Equipment malfunctions** - producing defective products
- **Environmental excursions** - humidity, temperature outside limits
- **Control system failures** - monitoring or recording problems

### Risks of Non-Conforming Materials

**Product safety risks:**

- **Food contamination** - unsafe packaging allowing bacteria growth
- **Chemical migration** - harmful substances transferring to food
- **Physical hazards** - packaging failure causing injuries
- **Allergen cross-contamination** - incorrect labelling or material selection

**Business risks:**

- **Customer complaints** - reputation damage and relationship issues
- **Product recalls** - costly retrieval and disposal of products
- **Regulatory action** - fines, warnings, or facility closure
- **Certification loss** - BRCGS or customer approval withdrawal

## Immediate Control Measures (BRCGS 3.11.1)

### Identification and Segregation

**Clear identification:**

- **Red tags or labels** - clearly mark non-conforming materials
- **Quarantine areas** - designated locations for non-conforming materials
- **Physical barriers** - prevent accidental use or mixing
- **Electronic systems** - block materials in computer systems

**Effective segregation:**

- **Separate storage** - away from conforming materials
- **Access control** - only authorised personnel can handle
- **Clear documentation** - what, when, why materials quarantined
- **Tracking systems** - maintain location and status information

### Communication Requirements

**Immediate notifications:**

- **Supervisor informed** - report discovery immediately
- **Quality team alerted** - technical assessment required
- **Production stopped** - if ongoing process affected
- **Documentation started** - begin non-conformance record

**Information to communicate:**

- **Material identification** - what material is non-conforming
- **Nature of problem** - how it fails to meet specification
- **Quantity affected** - how much material involved
- **Potential impact** - what products or customers affected
- **Discovery circumstances** - how and when problem found

## Decision-Making Process (BRCGS 3.11.2)

### Assessment Requirements

All non-conforming materials must be assessed by competent personnel:

- **Technical knowledge** - understanding of specifications and risks
- **Authority level** - appropriate decision-making responsibility
- **Risk assessment skills** - ability to evaluate safety implications
- **Documentation capability** - can record decisions and reasoning

### Four Possible Decisions

#### 1. Reject

**When to reject:**

- **Safety risk** - could compromise Product Safety
- **Quality failure** - significantly below specification
- **Customer requirements** - will not meet customer needs
- **Regulatory non-compliance** - violates legal requirements

**Rejection process:**

- **Immediate segregation** - prevent any possible use
- **Documentation** - record reasons for rejection
- **Disposal arrangements** - safe and appropriate disposal method
- **Supplier notification** - inform supplier of rejection and reasons

#### 2. Accept by Concession

**When to accept by concession:**

- **Minor deviation** - small departure from specification
- **No safety impact** - product still safe for intended use
- **Functional adequacy** - still performs required function
- **Customer agreement** - customer accepts the deviation

**Concession process:**

- **Risk assessment** - confirm no safety or quality impact
- **Customer approval** - obtain customer agreement if required
- **Limited use** - may restrict to specific applications
- **Documentation** - record concession decision and limits

#### 3. Rework

**When to rework:**

- **Correctable defect** - problem can be fixed
- **Economic viability** - cost of rework justified
- **Technical feasibility** - rework process available
- **Quality assurance** - rework will achieve specification

**Rework process:**

- **Rework procedure** - defined method to correct defect
- **Quality control** - verify rework achieves specification
- **Documentation** - record rework performed and results
- **Re-inspection** - confirm materials now conform

#### 4. Alternative Use

**When for alternative use:**

- **Different application** - suitable for less demanding use
- **Grade down** - use in lower specification products
- **Internal use** - use for trials or testing
- **Material recovery** - extract usable components

**Alternative use process:**

- **Suitability assessment** - confirm appropriate for alternative use
- **Specification change** - update documents for new application
- **Customer approval** - if required for new use
- **Clear labelling** - prevent confusion with original specification

## Documentation Requirements (BRCGS 3.11.2)

### Decision Documentation

**Required information:**

- **Material identification** - batch numbers, quantities, specifications
- **Non-conformance description** - exact nature of the problem
- **Assessment details** - who assessed, when, and how
- **Decision made** - reject, accept, rework, or alternative use
- **Reasoning** - why this decision was appropriate
- **Approval signatures** - competent person authorization
- **Implementation** - actions taken to implement decision

### Record Keeping

- **Non-conformance register** - central record of all incidents
- **Individual records** - detailed file for each incident
- **Trend analysis** - patterns in non-conformance types
- **Corrective actions** - measures to prevent recurrence
- **Customer notifications** - communications sent regarding incidents

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Non-Conformance Management ✓

- **Immediate action:** "I found off-colour film and immediately stopped production and quarantined the material"
- **Proper assessment:** "The quality manager assessed the material and decided it could be used for non-food contact applications"
- **Clear documentation:** "We recorded the decision, reasoning, and customer approval for the alternative use"
- **Prevention focus:** "We investigated the root cause and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence"

### Poor Practices to Avoid ✗

- **Ignoring problems:** "The colour is slightly off but probably no one will notice"
- **Unauthorised decisions:** "I decided we could use it anyway since we're behind schedule"
- **Poor segregation:** "I put it in the corner but didn't label it clearly"
- **Missing documentation:** "We sorted out the problem but didn't write anything down"

## Special Situations

### Customer-Specific Requirements

- **Different standards** - customers may have varying acceptance criteria
- **Approval processes** - some customers require advance approval for concessions
- **Documentation needs** - specific reporting formats or information required
