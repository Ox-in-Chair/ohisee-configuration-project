**ATTENTION**

* Before maintaining, please turn off the main power supply.
* Don't put tools randomly on the machine, because tools may scrape the surface of machine or fall and damage the equipment
* All the rollers that are dismantled due to maintenance or repair should be carefully conserved. Don't wear the roller and affect its function.
* Avoid oil product touching rubber roller directly or indirectly, and damage the rubber roller. The mandrel (shaft) of cylinder can get lubrication from the injection of FRL bit system (see below regarding FRL). No need to lubricate.
* Please do not use voluntarily mixes of oil or unclear background product.
* Maintenance of auxiliary units please refer to machine guide.

**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR METHODS**

**FRL SYSTEM**

The FRL bit system is in the left side of electric box. Please turn off the main power supply before opening it.

The procedure as follows:

1. In order to have a stable and effective validity of the air pressure system, there should be an air dryer in the compressor.
2. ![](data:image/png;base64...)Setting for air compressor - maximum is 9 bar and minimum is 6 bars.
3. The pressure gauge of FRL bit system should be 6 bars.
4. Set the value of oil drop as 1, which means it will drip a drop per minute. Check the cup of lubricate oil and replenish to 2/3 fill every month.
5. Check the filter cup and drain water every week.
6. Depending on the series of FRL bit system it may be equipped with an oil/water separator, which may drain water automatically. The drainpipe is under the machine. Please connect the drainpipe to the purification system if applicable

**DISMANTLE REWIND SHAFT & ADJUST HCI QUICK LOCK RING**

Based on these following reasons, operator has to dismantle rewind shaft and take out the HCI quick lock ring.

* Requirement for maintenance: Every month after using, take out the HCl quick lock ring from rewind shaft to decontaminate and lubricate it with heat proof lubricating oil.
* Change the direction of rewind shaft: The rewind direction must be changed to reverse via the man-machine dialogue system. The initial set direction is forward. If you want to change the rewind direction, at the same time, you also need to change the direction of HCI quick lock ring to reverse.

**ATTENTION**

The operation must be handled by trained or professional person, In order to prevent danger and injury as well as bad effect for regular rewinding performance because of the improper operation.

The air pressure source must be disconnected before dismantling, adjusting, cleaning, installing the HCI ring or Bakelite pusher. Also confirm to the pressure gauge that the air pressure has been eliminated completely.

**PART’S NAME AS INSTALL ORDER**

![](data:image/png;base64...)

* Turn off the main power and pull out the air pressure supply
* Make sure there is no output of side pressure.
* Dismantle these two fixed bearings and bushing. (Fig. 1)
* Take out all the spacer, ring and HCl quick lock ring.
* Decontaminate the HCI quick lock ring and lubricate it by heat proof lubricating oil, or adjust the direction (forward or reverse). (Fig.2)
* In proper order to install back the spacer, ring and HCI quick lock ring. Please install the ring up-and-down if the rewind shaft is grooved up-and-down. Also, make sure the directions of HCI quick lock ring should be accorded with each other. (You may change the original position of HCI quick lock ring to make the using life equally).
* ![](data:image/png;base64...)After installing, adjust the gap between the rewind shaft bushing and spacer to 5-7mm Then reinstall these two fixed bearings. (Fig.3)
