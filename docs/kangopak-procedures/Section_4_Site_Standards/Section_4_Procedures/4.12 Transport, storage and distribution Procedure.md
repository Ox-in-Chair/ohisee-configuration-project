# Procedure 4.12: Transport Storage Distribution Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 12
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## OBJECTIVE

To ensure incoming goods are appropriately checked for contents, packaging integrity and potential contamination.

To ensure that all materials and products are stored in such a way as to minimise the risk of contamination or malicious intervention and protect product safety, quality and legality.

To ensure that all raw materials and finished products are dispatched and transported in such a way as to minimise the risk of contamination or malicious intervention and protect product safety, quality and legality.

The above extends to:

- Raw Materials
- Work in Progress
- Finished Product

Risks arising from the use of recycled materials are not considered as recycled materials are not used.

## METHOD

### INCOMING GOODS

#### Incoming Raw Material Inspection

Incoming goods are inspected in accordance with the Incoming Raw Material Inspection Plan (5.4F1).

The Inspection Plan defines the scope, sampling frequency, and responsibility for Incoming Raw Material Inspection, and cross-refer to specific test methods and records.

This includes visual inspection of the material, the pallet and the packaging of the raw material (e.g. Pallet Slip Sheets, Wrapping). Non-conforming items are recorded on a Non Conformance advice, & the material demarcated & segregated. Refer to Control of Non-Conforming Product Procedure.

On receipt of raw material, the delivery note is checked against a purchase order and slitting pattern to ensure that the goods received match the specifications and requirements of the purchase order. To ensure that the correct raw materials and intermediate products are used to prevent a problem occurring further on in the process flow this check also serves as the validation for use.

Authorised Raw material Purchase Orders and Slitting patterns refer to RM Specifications & define specific requirements.

Raw Material Specifications are obtained from Suppliers & are reviewed for acceptability. Refer to Raw Material Specification Register.

#### Stock Rotation

Stock is monitored using labels which enable FIFO / FEFO practice.

Finished Goods and Work in progress labels have a sequential work order number which allows for older numbers to be dispatched or utilised first.

Raw Material labels have a production date on the label to allow for older stock to be utilised first.

### STORAGE OF ALL MATERIALS AND INTERMEDIATE AND FINISHED PRODUCTS

#### Product Identification

All Product is identified by means of labels which enable identification. Blue carton labels are used to identify work in progress cartons while white carton labels are used on the finished goods cartons.

Raw materials returned to stores after production are identified by means of a label which is completed by the operator with details of the raw material as per the work instruction. Refer to WI Bag Making DMF and AMJ (5.3.1) and WI Spout Inserting (5.3.4).

Product Identification is maintained to enable traceability to the extent defined on the Identification & Traceability Table. (Ref 3.9 Traceability Procedure)

#### External Packaging

External Packaging is used where appropriate to protect Product or raw material from degradation or contamination. Risks are assessed as an integral part of the HACCP study. Refer to HACCP study.

#### Storage Facilities (On & Off Site)

Safe storage conditions are maintained through cleaning and maintenance programs - Refer to Master Cleaning Schedules, Cleaning Methods and Checklists. Refer to Cleaning Procedure.

Hazardous chemicals are stored safely in accordance with the Chemical and Biological control procedure (Refer to 5.8.3).

Product is stored so as to prevent product damage and contamination applying, but not limited to, the following standards:

- Pest proof buildings
- Off the floor on pallets or racking
- Racking must not be closer than 1m from fire spray nozzles
- Reel Stock is covered with plastic by supplier, this is checked during incoming inspection
- Reel stock returned to store after production is covered with a blue plastic liner
- Finished goods and Work in progress are packed into cartons which are lined with plastic liners, cartons are sealed
- Zipper and Spouts are stored in sealed cartons which are inspected upon receipt as per incoming inspection
- Spouts returned to stores after production are stored in a sealed container lined with a plastic liner
- Zipper that is returned to store is kept in original carton and resealed
- Stored away from walls – at least 0.5m to enable effective cleaning and hygiene inspections
- Raw materials, Work in Progress & Finished product is stored in segregated storage areas
- Use of slip-sheets on wooden pallets for product protection
- Regular maintenance checks on warehouse and racking condition
- Maximum stacking height of 8m - product specific
- No combustible material stored directly underneath internal / external lights

### DISPATCH & TRANSPORT

#### Product Identification

All finished products are identified by means of carton labels.
Product Identification is maintained to enable traceability to the extent defined on the Identification & Traceability Table. (Ref 3.9 Traceability Procedure)

#### External Packaging

Finished products are protected by suitable external packaging, as detailed under the above standard for storage.

Where a third party transport contractor is utilised the pallet or cartons are wrapped in pallet wrap, in addition to the above mentioned external packaging, before dispatch to further protect against damage, contamination, taint or odour.

#### Vehicle & Product Inspection

The vehicle, product and pallets are inspected prior to loading to ensure the cleanliness of the vehicle, there is no evidence of taint, odour or malicious intervention and that pallets and slip sheets are in suitable condition. Refer to Vehicle Inspection Stamp.

Vehicles are physically secured during transit.

Company owned vehicles are cleaned in accordance with the Master Cleaning Schedule.

#### Third Party Transport

Third Party Transport Contactors enter into an agreement which is reviewed annually. (Refer to 4.12F2). Included in this agreement are Site rules which drivers must adhere to.

On arrival vehicles are inspected for cleanliness. Refer to Vehicle Inspection Stamp.

To minimise the risk of cross contamination no truck that has transported toxic or non-food grade materials is used to transport food packaging material.

#### General Carriers

When general carriers are used and a service level agreement is not in place, the packaging of finished product is adequate to protect the product against damage, contamination hazards, taint and odour.

#### Security

To ensure security of products during transit where stopping is required between destinations the drivers shall ensure that:

- The vehicle is not left unattended
- Physical security is checked periodically

### Pallet Management

Pallets must be of good quality, free from contamination, debris or splinters. If this is noted, the pallet must immediately be discarded into the general waste or returned to the supplier.

All pallets shall be stored in a clean, dry area in the warehouse ready for use in the warehouse & production facilities.

Only plastic pallets will be allowed into the production facility.

Slip sheets shall be used to separate the pallet surface from the finished goods to prevent any contamination.

Slip sheets must be of good quality, clean and free from contamination, debris or splinters.

Pallets & Slip Sheets shall be inspected quarterly during the GMP Audits, during the Vehicle Inspection performed at dispatch and during the Incoming Raw Material Inspection performed on delivery of raw materials.

### Stacking and Storing

Stacking and Storing is managed by the Stacking and Storing Inspector.

The Stacking and Storing Inspector's responsibility includes but not limited to:

- Ensure that all the requirements of the General Safety Regulations 8 are adhered to
- Ensure the stacking and storing area is neat and clean
- Ensure adherence to the BRC Storage and Distribution Procedure (4.12) is adhered to by all staff at all times
