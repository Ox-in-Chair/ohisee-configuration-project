# Procedure 4.10: Waste Management

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 12
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Commercial Manager
**Status:** Current

---

## Objective

To ensure that all waste (including sample waste) generated during the manufacturing process is stored, removed and disposed of in such a manner to minimise the risk of cross-contamination, pest infestation and adverse environmental impact.

## Definitions

### Hazardous Waste

Waste that is not classified as organic or general waste is mostly dangerous to humans and the environment.
Examples of hazardous waste are trim blades treated as medical waste & chemicals.

### Non Hazardous Waste

**General Waste**: All materials, such as plastic, cartons, and glass (but non-hazardous waste), are generated frequently. Most of this waste can be recycled or reused.

All disposable office waste is collected by municipal trucks and dumped at the nearest dumping site, where it is destroyed. Waste generated in the manufacturing process is collected by an approved service provider, who transports it to a designated third-party for recycling.

**Organic Waste**: Waste classified as biodegradable in the environment, e.g. banana peels.

## Method

### Waste Manifest

The Commercial Manager maintains a waste manifest that lists and categorises all forms of physical waste (recyclable, non-recyclable, and hazardous) generated and cross-references the relevant control measures and legal requirements. The Waste Manifest is reviewed at a minimum annually.

### Control Measures (Refer to Waste Manifest)

These include, as appropriate:

- Physical identification
- Document reference
- Physical quantity
- Service supplier

### Waste Containers

Where appropriate, waste is categorised according to legislative requirements based on the intended disposal means. It is sorted, segregated and protected against contamination where necessary.

Containers for waste and inorganic or hazardous substances are:

- Clearly identified for their intended purpose
- Located in a designated area
- Constructed of impervious material which are readily cleaned and sanitised
- The skip and secured lock when not in immediate use
- The skip is locked where the waste may pose a risk to the Product Safety & Legality

### Trademarked Waste

Labelled materials, products or printed packaging designated as waste is destroyed in-house and rendered unusable before disposal. All trademarked waste designated as waste is recorded on the Trademarked Waste Destruction & Disposal Record.

Trademarked waste shall be rendered unusable by manual intervention.

## Records

- Waste Manifest (4.10F1)
- Trademarked Waste Destruction & Disposal Record (4.10F2)
- Service Provider Contracts
- Disposal Certificates

**Responsibility:** Commercial Manager
