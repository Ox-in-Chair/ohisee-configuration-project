## 4.1 External Standards

All grounds within the site are finished and maintained to an appropriate standard.

### 4.1.1 Site Environment Assessment

Consideration is given to local activities and the site environment which may have an adverse impact on the quality of the finished product. Measures are in place to prevent contamination.

### 4.1.2 External Area Maintenance

The external areas are maintained in good order. Grounds are regularly tended and well maintained. External traffic routes under site control are tarred to avoid contamination of the product.

### 4.1.3 Building Fabric Maintenance

Building fabric is maintained to minimise potential for product contamination, pest entry, ingress of water and other contaminants. Where possible, a clean and unobstructed area is provided along the external walls of the buildings used for manufacturing and/or storage.

### 4.1.4 Drain Protection

Drains are properly protected to prevent entry of pests.

### 4.1.5 External Storage

No external storage of raw material is used at this stage.

## 4.2 Building Fabric and Interiors

**Raw Materials Handling, Preparation, Processing, Packing and Storage Areas**

The internal site, buildings and facilities are suitable for the intended purpose and shall be designed, constructed, maintained and monitored to effectively control the risk of product contamination.

### 4.2.1 Wall, Floor and Ceiling Maintenance

Walls, floors, ceilings and pipe work are maintained as per 4.0 Housekeeping and Cleaning procedure, finished and maintained in good condition to minimise the accumulation of dirt.

### 4.2.2 Suspended Ceilings

Not Applicable

### 4.2.3 Internal Drain Protection

All internal drain openings are protected against the entry of pests and designed to minimise odour.

### 4.2.4 Window and Glazing Protection

Where they constitute a risk to product, and based on the likelihood and risk of contamination, windows and roof glazing are protected against breakage.

### 4.2.5 Light Protection

Where they constitute a risk to product, and based on the likelihood and risk of non-production glass contamination, all bulbs and strip lights, including those on flying-insect control devices, are adequately protected.

### 4.2.6 Lighting Requirements

Suitable and sufficient lighting is provided to ensure a safe working environment, correct operation of processes, effective inspection of the product and cleaning.

### 4.2.7 Ventilation Systems

Suitable and sufficient ventilation is provided to prevent condensation, excessive dust, heat and fumes.

### 4.2.8 Door Maintenance

Doors are maintained in good condition. External doors are close-fitting and adequately proofed. Where doors need to be open, strip curtains are in place to prevent pest ingress.

### 4.2.9 Overhead Structures

Ceiling and overhead structures are constructed, finished and maintained to prevent risk of product contamination.

### 4.2.10 Floor Requirements

Floors are suitably hard-wearing to meet the demands of the operations and withstand cleaning materials and methods. Floors are maintained in good repair and facilitate cleaning.

### 4.2.11 Elevated Structures

Elevated Walkways, Access steps, mezzanine floors - Not Applicable.

## 4.3 Utilities

All utilities to and within the production and storage areas are designed, constructed, maintained and monitored to effectively control the risk of product contamination.

### 4.3.1 Water Quality

All water used in the manufacturing area that could impact product safety is suitable for the intended use, potable or suitably treated to prevent contamination. Water is tested against SANS 241: Drinking Water Standard.

### 4.3.2 Utility Monitoring

Based on risk assessment, the microbiological and chemical quality of water, steam, ice, air, compressed air or other gases, which do not constitute an ingredient but come in direct contact with packaging, are monitored.

## 4.4 Security

Security arrangements have been assessed to ensure the integrity of products and processes.

**Refer to 4.4 Security procedure.**

## 4.5 Layout and Product Flow

The factory layout, flow of processes and movement of personnel is sufficient to prevent the risk of product contamination and to comply with all relevant legislation.

### 4.5.1 Site Plans

There are plans of the site which define access points for personnel, travel routes, staff facilities, flows of manufacturing and storage areas.

### 4.5.2 Process Flow Design

The process flow from intake to despatch is arranged to minimise the risk of contamination or damage to the product.

### 4.5.3 Space and Storage Capacity

The factory has sufficient working space and storage capacity to enable all operations to be carried out properly under safe and hygienic conditions.

Equipment that is not used or that is taken out of service are cleaned and stored in a manner that does not pose a product safety risk.

## 4.7 Maintenance

Proper maintenance and monitoring of all equipment critical to product safety, quality and legality ensure consistent high levels of product safety, functionality and quality.

**Refer to 4.7 Maintenance Procedure**

## 4.8 Housekeeping and Cleaning

Housekeeping and cleaning systems are in place, which ensure that appropriate standards of hygiene are maintained and that risk of contamination to the product is minimised.
