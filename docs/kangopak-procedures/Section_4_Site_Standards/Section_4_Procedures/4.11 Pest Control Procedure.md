# Procedure 4.11: Pest Control

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 7
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Systems Coordinator
**Status:** Current

## Objective

To ensure that good manufacturing practices are implemented and maintained in order to minimise the risk of pest infestation.

## Method

### General Requirements

Hygiene, cleaning, incoming materials inspection and monitoring are implemented to avoid creating an environment conducive to pest activity.

### Pest Control Programme

The Systems Co-ordinator is appointed to manage pest control activities and to deal with the appointed external pest control contractor.

A registered pest control company is sub-contracted to eliminate target pests. The sub-contractor is registered by the Department of Agriculture and the service technicians are qualified and hold a National Certificate of Pest Control.

The Service Contract between the company and the sub-contractor is held by a nominated person.

Only Department of Agriculture registered pesticides are permitted.

A pest control file is maintained and includes:

- A service agreement that identify target pests
- A schedule of pesticide and their MSD sheets
- Service reports (Inspection, treatment, action taken and recommendations)
- Pesticides used and their quantities & concentration per service
- A site plan of all areas including positioning of rodent baits, flying insect control units and insect attractants, traps and/or detectors
- Pesticide antidote list and poison centre contact information
- Copy of service technician licences
- List of contact persons and their contact numbers

### Monitoring Pest Control

Effective preventive measures for rodents, insects and birds, are established in all areas. These include:

- Pest exclusion measures at entrances, floors, drains, windows, walls, piping and roofing
- Outside rodent bait stations: waterproof, numbered, tamper resistant and anchored
- Inside rodent bait stations in non-processing areas (i.e. services, offices and stores) labelled, numbered, tamper evident and anchored
- Fixed crawling insect detectors (including pheromone attractants and sticky traps) in processing areas but away from unsealed product conveyors or containers
- Flying insect control units where required, but not where insects will be attracted from outside the plant or less than three metres from any line or equipment. UV Tubes to be replaced annually
- Bird proofing where relevant

Detectors and traps are designed and located so as to prevent potential contamination of materials, product or facilities. They are appropriate for the target pest.

### Day to Day Sightings/Infestations

Employees understand the signs of pest activity. All sightings of pests are reported to the Systems Co-ordinator and recorded as an Incident on a Non Conformance Advice. The NCA is then captured on the NCA Trend Analysis by Systems Co-ordinator.

The external pest control company is notified immediately after each sighting and investigates the sighting within 24 hours and takes action.

The pest control company conducts follow-up inspections as follows:

- Cockroaches – 3 clear visits once a week
- Rodents – 3 clear visits every second day
- Other like fleas, flys, moths – once off

A Service Report is provided to the Systems Co-ordinator which is kept on file.

Infested Material found is handled as per the Control of non-conforming Product Procedure and segregated.

### Inspections at Set Intervals by External Pest Control Company

The external pest control company conducts an inspection, covering all aspects specified in the Service Contract. This is done at least monthly.

A Service Report, Monitoring System Report and Pest Activity Trend Analysis for bait boxes and flying-insect control devices are issued to the Systems Co-ordinator and kept on file. When the pest control company find evidence of pest infestation and made recommendations on the service report the following actions take place:

- Systems Co-ordinator records as an Incident on a Non Conformance Advice (NCA no. is written on service report for cross referencing)
- Root cause done
- Staff trained

To assess the suitability of its pest management programme to address variation in pest activity through different seasons, and consider any additional preventive activity required audits to be conducted on an annual basis as per Service Agreement.

A responsible and competent person is allocated to manage the activities of the service contractor. This person is adequately trained in pest control.

### Performance Measures and Reporting

- Pest Activity Trends
- Number and nature of audit findings
- Number and nature of non-conformances
- Number of pest related customer complaints

These performance measures are trended and reported in Management Meetings.

## Records

- Pest Control Service Reports (4.11F1)
- Non Conformance Advice forms (3.11F1)
- Pest Control File
- Service Contract
- NCA Trend Analysis
