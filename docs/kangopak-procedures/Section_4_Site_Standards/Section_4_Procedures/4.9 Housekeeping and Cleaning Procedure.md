# Procedure 4.9: Housekeeping & Cleaning

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 15
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Objective

To make sure housekeeping and cleaning systems are in place, which ensure that appropriate standards of hygiene are maintained and that risk of contamination to the product is minimised.

To ensure that a condition based or 'clean as you go' policy is maintained. This procedure is applicable to include manufacturing, storage and ancillary areas such as engineering workshop.

## Method

To make sure housekeeping and cleaning systems are in place, which ensure that appropriate standards of hygiene are maintained and that risk of contamination to the product is minimised. The frequency and methods of cleaning are based on risk.

### Periodic Detailed Cleaning

Master Cleaning Schedules (MCS) are maintained which define:

- Area
- Item to be cleaned
- Method reference
- Cleaning frequency
- Cleaning responsibility
- Monitoring and Verification arrangements
- Post-clean Inspections
- Pre start-up inspections

Refer to department specific Master Cleaning Schedules

Cleaning Methods are documented for all items referenced on the MCS defining:

- Area to be cleaned
- Method steps
- Hazards
- Cleaning equipment required and colour coded
- Chemicals, dilution rates, temperature and contact time (where relevant)

### Records

Cleaning methods are appropriate to type and nature of soil and include detail of equipment and detergents utilised. Cleaning activities shall not pose a risk to product safety.

On completion of the required cleaning the Cleaning Checklist is updated with a record of the cleaning conducted.

The Master Cleaning Schedules are validated to ensure that all parts of the establishment and equipment are cleaned and/or sanitised over a defined period.

### Maintenance Cleaning

Cleaning required by maintenance personnel on completion of maintenance work is referenced on the job card task description including the removal of debris, parts tools and lubricant excess. Maintenance personnel are involved in the periodic cleaning as referred to on the Master Cleaning Schedule.

The frequency of cleaning machinery and equipment is done as per the Master Cleaning Schedule however not always can weekly cleaning be performed on the predetermined day, which is a Monday.

This can be due to public holidays, forced shutdown and/or customer requirements needing for the machine to run.

If this is the case cleaning must take place in the same week on a different day at the earliest available time to avoid risk of product contamination.

Once completion of cleaning is done the Cleaning Checklists are completed by way of initial.

Checklists are taken into the office on the last of day of each month as daily cleaning needs to be performed up until the last day.

Verification of these checklists is performed weekly and the last verification occurs on the last day of each month.

Cleaning and replacing light fittings and glass is done under controlled conditions to minimise the potential for contamination.

### Detergents

A Master List of Detergents is maintained with a reference to the applicable chemical specification/material safety data sheet. All detergents are food grade. Only approved detergents from the Master List of Detergents used for cleaning and are referenced in the relevant Cleaning Methods defining the cleaning methods employed.

Detergents are positively identified by means of a label or equivalent and stored separately in a cupboard facility.

Chemicals that are strongly scented or could give rise to taint and odour contamination are not used.

In the event of a change in cleaning detergents, or supplier, the Admin Manager validates the effectiveness of the detergent and approves the detergent before it is added to the Master list of Detergents.

### Cleaning Equipment

Equipment is designed and made of material that will not result in debris or potential contamination. This equipment is stored in separate racking within the production environment to prevent cross contamination.

Materials and equipment used for cleaning toilets are segregated from those used elsewhere. Cleaning equipment is colour coded.

### Verification of Effectiveness

The verification of cleaning task effectiveness is done periodically via GMP audits and are conducted per area to verify cleanliness and good practices.

### Environmental Monitoring

Environmental risk assessment was conducted and scored low, this environmental monitoring programs of swabbing is updated in a documented sampling protocol.

The environmental monitoring programme is reviewed at least annually and whenever there are:

- Changes in manufacturing conditions, process flow or equipment which could impact the environmental monitoring programme
- Consistently negative results

### Waste Management

Waste generated is managed and controlled according to Waste Management Procedure.

### Performance Measures and Reporting

- Number and nature of audit findings
- Number and nature of non-conformances

These performance measures are trended and reported in the Production Meetings.
