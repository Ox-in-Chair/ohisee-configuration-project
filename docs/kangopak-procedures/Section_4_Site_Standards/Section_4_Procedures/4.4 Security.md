# Procedure 4.4: Security

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 9
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Director
**Status:** Current

---

## 1. Objective

This procedure defines the security framework required to protect Kangopak's employees, infrastructure, product integrity, and brand reputation. It establishes control measures to prevent unauthorised access, theft, tampering, or contamination and to ensure full alignment with Packaging Materials requirements for site security and product defence.

The objective is to create a secure operational environment through the implementation of physical controls, behavioural expectations, monitoring systems, and proactive risk management. To ensure that product and process integrity is assured through appropriate site security provision.

## 2. Method

### 2.1 Security Function – Responsibility & Accountability

The Director is accountable for the effective functioning of Kangopak's security system. This includes ensuring that adequate physical, digital, and procedural controls are in place and regularly reviewed to meet operational risks and regulatory expectations.

### 2.2 Risk Assessment

Kangopak conducts a documented risk assessment of its security arrangements to identify potential risks to product integrity arising from deliberate acts of contamination, sabotage, or damage. All areas of the facility are assessed according to risk. Sensitive and restricted zones are clearly defined, marked, monitored, and access-controlled.

A comprehensive site and product security risk assessment is carried out annually. The outcomes of this assessment inform the development and maintenance of a Product Defence Plan aimed at eliminating or reducing the identified risks.

Where necessary, Kangopak may appoint a qualified external Security Services Provider to support this process. In such cases, responsibilities are governed by a formal Service Level Agreement.

Key defence plan elements include, but are not limited to:

- Product Tamper Evidence
- Access Control
- Reference Checks during Recruitment
- Staff Security Awareness and Training
- Contractor Management
- IT Backup, Recovery, and Cybersecurity
- Records Protection and Access Control

### 2.3 Product Tamper Evidence

All finished goods are stored in secure, demarcated areas. Outer packaging is designed and verified to provide visible indicators of tampering. This serves both as a deterrent and as a verification step for outbound goods during dispatch or internal handling.

### 2.4 Access Control

Access to the site is controlled via designated entrances equipped with intercom systems, electronic keypad locks, and facial scanners. All employees, contractors, and visitors must enter through these points and comply with established entry protocols. Visitors are required to sign in at reception, complete a security and hygiene questionnaire, and always be escorted by an authorised host. Before entering production zones, they are issued the appropriate protective clothing and safety equipment.

In the interest of maintaining a secure site, all keypad access codes are changed immediately upon the resignation or dismissal of any employee.

### 2.5 Reference Checks (Recruitment)

All prospective employees undergo a comprehensive background verification process that includes reference checks and targeted questions related to security and ethical conduct. These records are retained in the official recruitment file and reviewed during the onboarding process. This step serves as a critical barrier against insider threats, helping to establish a culture of accountability and trust from the outset of employment.

### 2.6 Staff Training

All employees receive mandatory training on Kangopak's security policy and procedures during induction. This training includes the importance of personal responsibility, reporting obligations, and expected conduct related to site security. Staff are encouraged to challenge or report unidentified or suspicious individuals on site and to cooperate fully with investigations where required.

### 2.7 Contractors

Contractors performing work on-site must be supervised at all times by a designated Kangopak employee. They are subject to the same access and conduct controls as permanent staff. The responsible person is accountable for ensuring the contractor's adherence to all safety and security rules for the duration of the contract.

### 2.8 Personal Items

Employees are required to store all personal items in the designated locker areas. Bags, jackets, and any non-essential items are not permitted on the production floor. No medication may be brought into production areas unless approved for medical necessity and documented. These measures minimise the risk of cross-contamination, tampering, or unauthorised removal of goods or equipment.

### 2.9 Unusual Behaviour

All staff must remain vigilant and report any behaviour that may compromise site security. Examples include unauthorised access attempts, lingering near restricted areas without purpose, using devices to record or photograph sensitive operations, or inquiries about company processes from unknown individuals. Kangopak promotes a proactive safety culture where concerns are promptly escalated.

### 2.10 Incoming Materials Inspection

All raw materials, packaging, and returned goods are subject to visual inspection on arrival. Items are checked for signs of tampering, contamination, or counterfeiting—including unusual residues, broken seals, inconsistent labelling, and odours. Any suspicious deliveries are isolated and investigated immediately before release into production.

### 2.11 Investigation of Suspicious Activity

The Production Manager is responsible for responding to all reports of suspicious behaviour, missing items, or physical security breaches. If an intentional act or criminal offence is suspected, the matter is escalated to senior management and, where appropriate, reported to law enforcement or regulatory bodies. Investigations are conducted objectively and in line with Kangopak's disciplinary procedure and relevant labour legislation.

### 2.12 IT Systems Control and Backup

All data critical to the operation is securely backed up daily onto an external drive, which is stored off-site outside working hours. A secondary automatic backup occurs via a cloud-based service. This ensures redundancy, fast recovery in the event of system loss, and protection against tampering or corruption of records.

### 2.13 Records Control

Access to operational records is strictly governed by defined user roles and password protection. Documents are stored digitally in the shared drive with version control, and hard copies—where required—are stored in locked cabinets accessible only to authorised personnel.

### 2.14 Performance Measures and Reporting

All product integrity and site security incidents are logged, trended, and reviewed at monthly management meetings. Incidents are analysed for root causes, with appropriate corrective actions recorded and followed through. Trends inform changes to the security plan and staff training priorities.

### 2.15 Control of High-Value and Critical Production Components

Sealer bars, ratchet sets, precision tools, and other high-value items are essential to Kangopak's sealing accuracy, product integrity, and production performance. Improper use, loss, or unauthorised access to these components poses risks to product quality, safety, and regulatory compliance. These components shall be protected under strict physical and procedural controls as outlined below:

- **Storage**: Sealer bars and other critical items must be stored in a lockable steel cabinet located within each relevant production department
- **Access Control**: Cabinet keys are issued only to authorised personnel appointed by the Production Manager. A backup key is secured in the central key safe. Duplicate keys are prohibited unless the Production Manager provides written approval
- **Access Logbook**: Each cabinet contains a hardcopy register that must be completed for every sign-out and sign-in transaction. Log entries must include the date, time, username, purpose of use, and the machine involved. The logbook ensures traceability and accountability for every interaction with critical equipment
- **Training and Responsibility**: Team Leaders and authorised users are trained on this procedure and must sign off on their responsibilities. Personnel are made aware that negligence or misuse may result in disciplinary action
- **Monitoring and Audits**: The Production Manager and Maintenance Technician conduct weekly spot checks to verify tool availability, condition, and logbook accuracy
- **Loss/Damage Reporting**: Any missing, damaged, or unaccounted items must be reported immediately to the Production Manager and quarantined under the Maintenance Procedure until a formal inspection and repair decision is made

### 2.16 Security Cameras – Access, Monitoring, and Application

Kangopak operates a security camera system to support product integrity, personnel safety, and process compliance. Security cameras are installed at strategic locations based on the annual Site Security Risk Assessment and Product Defence Plan.

These cameras are not monitored continuously, but are reviewed in the event of an incident, a reported breach, or an audit requirement. The system plays a crucial role in deterring theft, verifying compliance, and facilitating investigations.

Access to footage is restricted to authorised management and IT personnel, with all access logged. Footage is stored securely in encrypted cloud infrastructure and retained for a period defined in the IT Policy. Cameras are not installed in private areas such as bathrooms or changing rooms.

Footage may be used to verify incidents such as:

- Theft, damage, or tool misuse
- Loitering, sleeping on duty, or extended breaks
- Failure to wear PPE or follow startup/cleaning protocols
- Harassment, misconduct, or breaches of company policy

Security camera data may be used as evidence in disciplinary or legal processes. All employees are informed of the system and expected to comply with Kangopak's security and behavioural standards.

### 2.17 Security of External Structures

All external storage tanks, silos, and intake pipes with exposure to product or raw materials are secured through physical locks, tamper-evident seals, and limited access protocols. These areas are assessed annually as part of the security risk review. Any third-party access is supervised and documented.

### 2.18 Dispatch and Transport Security

Before dispatch, all goods are inspected for integrity, seal condition, and correct documentation. Where applicable, tamper-evident seals are applied and recorded. Third-party drivers are restricted to approved areas and must be accompanied when entering loading zones. Kangopak transport contracts or service agreements outline the carrier's responsibilities for security and compliance. All dispatches are documented and traceable, with seal numbers recorded and signed off.

### 2.19 Security Enforcement of Conduct and Prohibited Possessions

Kangopak maintains a zero-tolerance policy on specific forms of misconduct that present risks to employee safety, product integrity, and legal compliance. The following are strictly prohibited on-site:

- Firearms, ammunition, or any offensive weapons
- Alcohol or unauthorised substances
- Removal of Kangopak assets without documented authorisation

Kangopak reserves the right to inspect lockers, vehicles, and personal property on-site when there is reasonable suspicion. Searches are conducted with respect and in line with legal and company protocols.

Any confirmed incident involving theft, possession of weapons, or serious misconduct will result in immediate suspension and may lead to potential legal action. Security camera footage may be used as supporting evidence in disciplinary proceedings. Violations of this clause may result in dismissal and referral to law enforcement.
