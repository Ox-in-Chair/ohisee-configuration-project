## OBJECTIVE

Kangopak ensures that all Staff are adequately trained, instructed and supervised in accordance with their activity and that they are competent to undertake their job role.

## METHOD

### Initial Training and Supervision

To ensure that all relevant personnel adequately understand the role they are expected to undertake while working within raw materials handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage areas, Kangopak ensures that staff, including temporary staff and contractors, receives training to a level in accordance with their responsibility and the type of work carried out.

Kangopak carries out the following:

- Induction training for all staff, covering company policies on hygiene and quality requirements, and the hazard and risk management system

- Training of those Staff involved with identified manufacturing process control points that are relevant to areas in which they may work

- Training in areas that have an impact on food safety, such as cleaning, machine operation, quality inspections and sampling

- Hygiene training is included in induction training

New or changed procedures, working methods and practices related to product safety or quality are communicated to relevant personnel via the following methods appropriate to the change:

- Staff briefings on updated procedures, work instructions and practices with attendance recorded
- Evidence within training records of the updated version of a procedure or work instruction recorded
- Requesting that all relevant staff sign the updated procedure or work instruction and that this is kept as a record of completion

All Staff, Temporary workers and Contractors are adequately supervised throughout the working period.

The requirements of this section apply to general duties as well as to specific job training.

### Ongoing competency

Although initial training is essential, Kangopak ensures that its personnel comprehend the training given and can demonstrate competency on a continuing basis. This ongoing assessment takes place in many ways (e.g. through one-to-one appraisals, team performance monitoring by line managers, review of results of internal audits or record review). Where the need is identified, there is appropriate refresher training, coaching, mentoring or on-the-job experience to improve skills and understanding (6.1F4 & 6.1F5).

### Record Keeping

Records of Training (6.1F1) carried out are kept. The records include:

- Employee Name
- Confirmation of attendance
- Date and duration of Training
- Course title and contents
- Training provider (Internal/External)

### Documented Training Programme

Kangopak has a documented training programme where job role competencies are identified, actions are undertaken to ensure that staff obtain these competencies, and a review of the effectiveness of these actions is carried out. A job Training Matrix (6.1F2) is used to list all job roles on site together with details of which procedures and work instructions are required for each role. A Training Plan (6.1F3) is derived and used to schedule and record Training needs identified and undertaken. All training is conducted in the appropriate language of Staff.

## Performance Measures and Reporting

Staff Training is reviewed as a minimum at the annual Management Review.
