# Procedure 6.1.2: BRC Disciplinary Code and Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 4
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Human Resources Manager
**Status:** Current

## OBJECTIVE

To create a procedure for correcting alleged transgressions or breaches of policies and procedures.
To apply an appropriate sanction for such a breach to correct the unacceptable conduct or behaviour.

## DEFINITION OF DISCIPLINE

Discipline is any corrective action initiated by Management in response to unacceptable employee behaviour or performance designed to promote orderly conduct.

## PURPOSE

To create acceptable standards and norms for a harmonious working environment, this takes into account the rights of all employees and the employer and fosters an environment of productivity and good customer service and care.

## TYPES OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

Typically, formal disciplinary action will only be taken where Counselling, Verbal Warnings or Written Warnings are inappropriate.

The company may take one of the following kinds of disciplinary action depending on the seriousness of the transgression, the disciplinary and service record of the employee, and bearing in mind the intention of the sanction should primarily be corrective and preventive in nature:

- Final written warning
- Dismissal with notice (or payment instead of notice)
- Summary dismissal (without notice)
- Alternatives to dismissal, e.g. demotion

Dismissal will only be appropriate where one of the following applies:

- The employee has failed to heed attempts to draw attention to his/her failings
- Where there is no reasonable prospect of a viable, ongoing employment relationship
- The employment relationship has been irreparably damaged
- It is probable that the employee might repeat the act and cause considerable damage to the Company's operation, its interests or reputation, or the employees' interests and welfare

## STEPS IN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE

The nature of offences may differ, ranging from minor to moderate to very serious. The first step in the Disciplinary procedure is issuing a verbal or informal warning. More serious offences may escalate to a written warning and, in the most severe cases, to final written warnings and potentially dismissal (termination of employment).

### Step 1: Verbal/Informal Warning

- The immediate supervisor typically issues these for minor offences in behaviour or performance
- A formal record of such warnings should be retained in the employee's personal file
- No witnesses are required for this step

### Step 2: Written Warning (Without a Disciplinary Hearing)

- If no improvement follows a verbal warning or when an incident justifying a more serious response is reported, the employer shall investigate as soon as possible after the incident is brought to their attention
- The investigation involves questioning the employee/s and differentiating between facts, opinions, and hearsay
- If the employer (usually the departmental head or manager) concludes that a more severe action is warranted, a written warning may be issued without proceeding to a Disciplinary Hearing
- The written warning should clearly state the nature of the offence and the expected improvements or corrections needed
- A formal record of the written warning should be retained in the employee's personal file

### Step 3: Incident Enquiry (Leading to a Final Written Warning or Dismissal)

- If the situation warrants actions beyond a written warning or an offence is severe enough to justify a final written warning or potential dismissal, then an Incident inquiry is conducted
- The exact process of investigation, as in Step 2, applies here
- Based on the outcome of the Incident Enquiry, the employer decides whether to proceed to a Disciplinary Hearing

### Step 4: Disciplinary Hearing (For Final Written Warning or Dismissal)

- If the Incident Enquiry suggests further action is needed, or if the offence is blatant, a Disciplinary Hearing is scheduled
- The Hearing must be held as soon as possible following the Incident inquiry, ideally within a week of the offence
- Notice of the hearing is given in writing
- The Disciplinary Hearing involves a panel of two senior managers, one of whom will act as an unbiased Chairperson (not the manager who conducted the Incident Enquiry)
- Participants include the employee, a fellow employee as representative (if requested), an interpreter (if necessary), the complainant, witnesses, and a HR representative as a scribe/observer to ensure correct procedures

## CONDUCTING THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING

**Disciplinary action for serious transgressions**

- Category: Any alleged misconduct requiring strong action that could result in a written warning, final written warning, or dismissal
- Level: Senior Member of Management

The hearing must be held private and be free of any interruptions.

At the hearing, the employee must be informed of all the facts surrounding the incident, and any witnesses shall be heard.

The employee and his chosen representative shall be allowed to call any witnesses, ask any questions of any witnesses, and state their case.

An accurate record of all proceedings shall be kept.

The chairperson shall make a finding and communicate his finding and the action to be taken to the employee.

In deciding what the penalty must be, the chairperson must take into consideration factors such as:

- The circumstances of the employee, including length of service and previous disciplinary record
- Personal circumstances
- The Nature of the job
- The circumstances surrounding the infringement itself

### Timing of the hearing

The Manager, as soon as practically possible, will initiate a disciplinary hearing after the incident and after Management concludes, because of an initial investigation/enquiry, that formal disciplinary proceedings should be instituted.

### Evidence

Evidence substantiating the alleged transgression(s) against the employee will be presented, and the latter will be entitled to cross-examine evidence led against him/her to state his/her case thoroughly and to lead any witnesses as available to support his/her cause. The employee's representative will be entitled to cross-examine and lead evidence as appropriate and speak to support the employee's cause.

In assessing the evidence presented, the Chairperson will consider:

- If the hearing was held within a reasonable time after the alleged breach of rules, or failure to comply with procedures
- If proper notification was given to the employee explaining the nature of the alleged breach of the rules or procedures
- If the employee was given adequate time to prepare his/her response to the allegation(s)
- If the chairperson acted neither as a complainant nor a witness
- If the hearing occurred before a sanction or remedy was determined
- If the employee was present and comprehending throughout the hearing
- If the proper allegation (in terms of the Disciplinary Code) was put to the employee
- If all the evidence the complainant relied on was presented at the hearing
- If the employee was allowed to question witnesses and give evidence him/herself in the presence of a representative
- If the chairperson considered separately whether the alleged rule has been breached
- If, after finding guilt on the balance of probabilities, a decision has been reached on the appropriate sanction or remedy

Before deciding on the sanction or the remedy, consider:

- The nature and the severity of the misconduct
- The sanction imposed upon other employees for similar behaviour
- The service/disciplinary record and personal circumstances of the employee
- Mitigating and aggravating factors
- The practice within the Company

### Records of the Hearing

The proceedings will be minuted and, should the Chairperson deem it appropriate, may be recorded to compile minutes.

### Reaching a verdict

Having heard all the evidence, it is recommended that the chairman does not give an immediate finding. He should adjourn the meeting to give thought to the case under consideration.

Thereafter, the chairperson shall decide whether the employee is guilty or innocent and inform the employee accordingly.

Should the employee be found "guilty", the Chairperson shall, where appropriate, refer to the employee's personnel file and work and disciplinary history and request that any evidence in mitigation be presented to the hearing.

### Sanction

The Chairman will again adjourn to consider a suitable sanction. The Chairperson will decide on the appropriate sanction considering the total evidence.

Any sanction the Chairperson decides shall be conveyed to the employee in writing.

### Appeal

Within two working days of receipt of the above decision, the employee may appeal in writing to senior management, stating the grounds for the appeal.

## OUTCOME OF THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING

The outcome of a Disciplinary Hearing may result in:

- The employee was found not guilty of the offence
- A written warning was issued
- A final written warning was issued
- Termination of service (Dismissal) with notice or payment in lieu of notice
- Summary Dismissal – which means termination without notice or payment in lieu of notice

### Period of Validity of warnings (See Disciplinary Hearing Report and Sanction Form)

All warnings must be recorded in writing and filed within the employees' personal records.

- Written Warnings must remain on record for six months
- Final Written Warnings must remain on record for 12 months

## APPEAL PROCEDURE

**Category:** Any alleged misconduct requiring strong action, resulting in a decision to terminate employment.

Only in the event of a disciplinary hearing resulting in a decision to terminate service will the employee have the right to request in writing that a senior manager review his/her case.

This request must be submitted within two working days of the employee being advised of his termination.

A senior manager not involved in the disciplinary hearing must review the case.

Where the firm has used its total management complement in the earlier proceedings, the matter may be reviewed by an independent person who is unbiased and of approved seniority or experience.

The Manager or a Management nominee of a level equal or higher than the Chairperson of the initial hearing will convene and commence an appeal hearing within ten working days of receiving the appeal notice.

The following persons may be present at the Appeal Hearing:

- The Appeal Chairperson
- A management representative, where practical and appropriate (e.g. the previous Complainant may act as a witness)
- The employee concerned
- A representative elected by the employee
- An interpreter, if necessary
- Human Resources Representative

The Chairperson will address the grounds of the Appeal as detailed in the application. The Chairperson will be required to objectively review the existing evidence submitted at the Disciplinary Hearing and hear any new evidence which might lead.

The Chairperson's decision shall be handed down two working days after completion of the appeal proceedings and in writing.

A record to this effect shall be placed in the employee's personnel file and copies given to the employee and the Chairperson of the initial hearing.

The Chairperson's decision shall be final in so far as the disciplinary procedure is concerned.

Should the employee be dissatisfied with the outcome, he/she may invoke his/her and refer the matter in terms of the Labour Relations Act requirements.

## OVERVIEW OF TRANSGRESSIONS

In the interest of consistency, the disciplinary action to be taken when a specific Company rule has been transgressed must be clearly stated; the disciplinary decision should be taken with careful consideration first given to the circumstances surrounding each case. There will be cases when the circumstances in which a transgression is committed would make the application of the prescribed sanction excessive and, consequently, substantively unfair. Each case must be measured under the prevailing circumstances.

The sanctions listed below will, therefore, be applied only as guidelines for the consistent discipline of employees and will be fairly and appropriately applied in relation to the substantive factors of prevailing circumstances.

Any other action of an employee detrimental to the employment relationship and/or clients/customers of the employer may also be regarded as a transgression in terms of the disciplinary code.

Due regard will be given to Chapter VIII and Schedule 8 of the Labour Relations Act, No 66 of 1995.

**Note:**
An employee may be suspended, on full pay, pending the disciplinary hearing, if the circumstances are such that the employment relationship or the relationship between employees or the disciplinary process could be harmed by the employee's presence on the premises.

Such a suspension is not part of the disciplinary sanction but is implemented temporarily.

Notice of suspension will be given to the relevant employee in writing.

**NOTE:**
This Disciplinary Code and Action steps to be taken, as well as the categorisation of offences above, are merely guidelines and may in its application differ due to the variation of the merits and circumstances of each case.
