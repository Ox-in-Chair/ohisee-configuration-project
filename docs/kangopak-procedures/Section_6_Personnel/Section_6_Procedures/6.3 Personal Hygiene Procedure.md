# Procedure 6.3: BRC Personal Hygiene Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 11
**Revised Date:** 2025-07-15
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Purpose

To ensure:

- Personal hygiene standards are documented and adopted by all personnel, including visitors to the production facility
- That these standards reduce the risk of product contamination
- Health conditions likely to adversely affect product safety is monitored and controlled
- Appropriate protective clothing is worn in production and storage areas to minimise the risk of product contamination

## Method

### Personal Hygiene Risk Assessment

A documented Personal Hygiene Risk Assessment (6.3F6) is maintained to evaluate all potential risks associated with personnel hygiene practices, including but not limited to:

- Hair and beard control
- Protective clothing use and laundering
- Hand hygiene practices
- Eating, drinking, and smoking controls
- Cuts, wounds, and plaster use
- Jewellery and personal items
- Fingernail and cosmetic standards
- Perfume/aftershave and taint risks
- Medicines, lockers, and personal belongings
- Medical screening and infectious diseases
- Daily hygiene compliance monitoring

The assessment identifies likelihood, severity, and risk level for each hygiene aspect. For each, specific control measures and verification actions (e.g., supervisor checks, plaster register reviews, audits, or retraining triggers) are documented and implemented.

The Personal Hygiene Risk Assessment is:

- Reviewed annually or whenever changes occur (new products, processes, or regulatory requirements)
- Used to verify compliance during internal audits, supervisor checks, and management review

### Personnel Practices

All personnel, visitors and contractors are required to comply with the requirements set out in this procedure and the Personal hygiene standard.

### Personal Hygiene Standard

Documented standards are established addressing the following issues:

- Personal hygiene
- Protective clothing
- Jewellery
- Eating
- Drinking
- Smoking
- Nails and false eyelashes
- Medicines
- Lockers/canteen
- Gloves

These standards are treated as controlled documents and displayed at strategic points throughout the factory.

### Training

Training of personnel in these Standard Practices is a mandatory element of the annual refresher training. Refer to the Skills Matrix and Training Procedure

## Protective Clothing

Hazard and risk principles are used to determine the need for protective clothing, including garments and footwear in raw materials handling, preparation, production and storage areas. Personnel who work in, or enter into, areas where exposed products and/or materials are handled wear protective clothing that is fit for purpose, clean and in good condition (e.g. free from rips, tears or fraying material).

The details of protective and other garments are detailed in the Personnel Hygiene Standard.

The requirement for protective equipment (hair coverings, beard snoods, protective clothing, footwear, and gloves) is detailed in the Protective Clothing Risk Assessment (6.5F1). The Personal Hygiene Risk Assessment (6.3F6) focuses on the hygiene risks, controls, and compliance checks linked to those PPE requirements.

### Issues – Permanent Personnel

All permanent personnel are issued with protective clothing and a pair of safety shoes at the time of their appointment. Replacements are made annually or when damaged or lost.

### Issues – Casual Personnel (Temps)

Temporary workers are issued protective clothing and safety shoes on initiation of the contract. Thereafter items are renewed based on the duration of the contract

### Laundry of Protective Clothing

An external laundry service provider is located on site where employees hand in and collect clean protective clothing. Employees do not take protective clothing home.

## Personal Hygiene Facilities and Toilets

Personnel hygiene facilities are available to ensure that the degree of personal hygiene required can be maintained. The facilities are located close to the points where hygiene requirements apply and are clearly designated. These facilities do not open directly onto production, packing or storage areas.

An adequate number of toilets of appropriate hygienic design, each with hand washing, sufficient quantity of warm water, unscented liquid soap, disposable hand towels, advisory signs and where relevant, sanitising facilities are provided.

## Hand Wash Facilities

Suitable and sufficient hand wash facilities are available at strategic points to enable cleaning of hands before commencing work, after breaks, and as necessary during the course of work. Refer to Personal Hygiene standard

## Staff Canteens and Designated Eating Areas

Staff canteens and designated areas for food storage and consumption are situated so that the potential for cross contamination of production areas is minimised.

Staff canteens are managed to ensure hygienic storage of ingredients and preparation, storage and serving of prepared foods.

Food lockers for employees' own food are provided in the canteen. All food brought into manufacturing premises are stored in a clean hygienic state.

**NO FOOD** i.e allergens – cereals, eggs, cow's milk, soy, fish, crustaceans & molluscs, peanuts and tree nuts is permitted in the factory (which includes production, change rooms, toilets, workshop and warehouse).

## Medicals

A Medical Screening Questionnaire is completed by each applicant along with an Employment Application Form. Health conditions likely to adversely affect product safety is monitored and controlled. Refer to the personal hygiene standard.

## Visitors and Contractors

All visitors and contractors are required to report to Reception for site access. At reception, they are met with and escorted through site by their host. Prior to entering processing areas, they are issued with the necessary Protective Clothing / equipment and are required to comply with all relevant requirements of the Product Safety and Quality Management System.

Visitors entering the manufacturing facilities require to complete a visitors questionnaire
