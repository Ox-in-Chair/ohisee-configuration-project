## FACILITATOR GUIDE

### Pre-Session Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Current glass and brittle plastic registers (recent copies)
- [ ] Inspection forms for hands-on practice (70 copies)
- [ ] Mock NCA forms for emergency response practice
- [ ] Defective samples for inspection training (cracked plastic, loose items)
- [ ] Timer for timed exercises
- [ ] Individual competency verification forms (65 copies)
- [ ] Updated contact list for emergency reporting

### Presenter Notes & Safety Emphasis

#### Opening Section (10 minutes)
**Safety Emphasis Approach:**
- Start with recent industry recall examples to establish seriousness
- **Key phrase:** "Foreign body contamination is not 'just possible' - it happens regularly in packaging facilities"
- Emphasise personal responsibility: "Each person is a critical control point"
- Address complacency: "Experience doesn't make you immune to missing risks"

**Common Resistance Points:**
- "We've never had a major incident here"
- **Response:** "Prevention is why we haven't had incidents - maintaining vigilance keeps it that way"
- "These checks take too much time"  
- **Response:** "5 minutes of inspection prevents hours of cleanup and potential recalls"

#### Hazard Recognition Section (35 minutes)
**Glass vs. Brittle Plastic Distinction:**
- **Physical demonstration:** Show how brittle plastic shatters vs. flexible plastic bends
- **Risk equality:** "Both glass and brittle plastic pose the same contamination risk"
- **Age factor:** "Plastic becomes more brittle with age and UV exposure"

**Inspection Quality Standards:**
- **Thoroughness emphasis:** "Quick glances miss critical defects"
- **Documentation importance:** "Undocumented inspections are legally worthless"
- **Risk-based thinking:** "Higher risk items need more frequent, careful inspection"

**Emergency Response Critical Points:**
- **Speed vs. thoroughness:** "Act quickly but systematically - panic causes more contamination"
- **Area isolation:** "Wider containment is safer than insufficient containment"
- **Communication clarity:** "Describe location, extent, and immediate actions taken"

### Timing Management Strategies

**If Running Behind:**
- **Reduce identification exercise to 5 minutes** (Section 1)
- **Combine inspection practice with assessment** (reduce separate practice time)
- **Focus on most critical emergency actions** (skip detailed NCA completion practice)

**If Ahead of Schedule:**
- **Extended Q&A period** with real workplace scenarios
- **Additional practice** with more complex inspection scenarios
- **Deeper dive** into recent industry case studies

### Real Contamination Examples (Anonymised)

**Example 1: Light Bulb Incident**
*"A packaging facility had a fluorescent tube break above a production line. Despite immediate cleanup efforts, glass fragments were found in 47 finished packages during quality inspection. Cost: R127,000 in destroyed product plus 3-day production shutdown."*

**Learning Point:** Even with quick response, contamination can be extensive.

**Example 2: Brittle Plastic Gauge**
*"A pressure gauge with a cracked plastic face shattered during routine operation. Fragments contaminated 15 metres of packaging line. The crack had been visible for 3 days but not reported."*

**Learning Point:** Small defects become big problems - immediate reporting is critical.

**Example 3: Personal Spectacles**
*"An operator's prescription glasses broke during shift change. Plastic fragments were not immediately identified as contamination risk. Customer complaint led to recall of 2,300 units."*

**Learning Point:** Personal items are as dangerous as facility equipment when they break.

### Escalation Procedures Reference

#### Immediate Escalation (Within 10 minutes)
1. **Direct Supervisor:** First point of contact for any breakage
2. **Production Manager:** If supervisor unavailable or incident is significant
3. **Quality Manager:** For potential product contamination assessment

#### Secondary Escalation (Within 30 minutes)
1. **Site Manager:** Major incidents affecting production schedule
2. **Technical Manager:** Equipment-related breakage requiring expert assessment
3. **External authorities:** If regulatory reporting required

#### Documentation Escalation (Same day)
1. **NCA completion:** Must be finished within 8 hours of incident
2. **Incident investigation:** Root cause analysis within 24 hours
3. **Corrective actions:** Prevention measures implemented within agreed timeframe
