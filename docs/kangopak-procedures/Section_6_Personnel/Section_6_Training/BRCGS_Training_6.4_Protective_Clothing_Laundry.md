Taking protective clothing home for washing can introduce contaminants from your home environment into the food packaging factory. Professional laundry services ensure clothing is cleaned to Product Safety standards.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (6.5.7):** Home laundering of protective clothing must be prevented to avoid contamination risks.

**Kangopak Standard:** An external laundry service provider is located on-site where employees hand in and collect clean protective clothing. Employees must never take protective clothing home.
