**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Internal Audit Procedure

# Internal Auditor Training

**Module:** Internal Auditor Training  
**Audience:** Designated internal auditors only  
**BRCGS Reference:** 3.5.3  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 3.3 BRC Internal Audit Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Plan** and conduct internal audits using appropriate auditing techniques and BRCGS requirements
2. **Identify** non-conformances and assess their significance for product safety and quality management
3. **Document** audit findings clearly and objectively with sufficient evidence to support conclusions

## Why Internal Audits Are Essential

Internal audits provide independent verification that our quality and product safety management system is working effectively. They identify problems before customers or external auditors find them, and help drive continuous improvement.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (3.5.3):** Internal audits must be carried out by appropriately trained and competent auditors.

**Kangopak Requirement:** All internal auditors are trained in relevant auditing techniques to conduct the annual BRCGS Systems Compliance Audit and other scheduled audits.

## Understanding Internal Auditing

### Purpose of Internal Audits
**System verification:** Confirm procedures are being followed as documented
**Effectiveness assessment:** Evaluate whether the system achieves intended outcomes  
**Compliance checking:** Verify adherence to BRCGS requirements and legal obligations
**Improvement identification:** Find opportunities to enhance performance
**Preparedness:** Ready the organisation for external audits and customer visits

### Types of Internal Audits
**Systems audits:** Review of entire management system against BRCGS standard
**Process audits:** Detailed examination of specific processes or departments
**Compliance audits:** Check adherence to specific requirements or regulations
**Follow-up audits:** Verify corrective actions from previous audits have been effective

### Audit Principles
**Independence:** Auditors must be impartial and objective
**Evidence-based:** All findings must be supported by verifiable evidence
**Risk-focused:** Concentrate on areas with highest potential impact
**Systematic:** Follow structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage

## BRCGS Standard Structure

### Understanding the Standard
**Section 1:** Senior management commitment and continuous improvement
**Section 2:** Hazard and risk management system (HACCP)
**Section 3:** Quality and Product Safety management system
**Section 4:** Site standards (infrastructure and environment)
**Section 5:** Product control (specifications and processes)
**Section 6:** Personnel (training, hygiene, welfare)

### Fundamental Requirements
**Must be in place for certification:**
- All fundamental requirements fully implemented
- No non-conformities against fundamental requirements allowed
- Critical to maintaining BRCGS certification status

**Key areas to focus on:**
- Management commitment and culture
- HACCP system implementation
- Prerequisite programmes
- Customer and regulatory compliance

## Audit Planning and Preparation

### Annual Audit Programme
**Scope determination:**
- **All activities** must be audited at least annually
- **Risk-based frequency** for critical areas
- **Seasonal activities** included when operational
- **New processes** or changes audited promptly

### Individual Audit Planning
**Pre-audit preparation:**
1. **Define audit scope** and objectives clearly
2. **Review relevant documentation** (procedures, previous audits, customer feedback)
3. **Prepare audit checklist** based on BRCGS requirements
4. **Schedule audit** with appropriate personnel
5. **Gather reference materials** (standards, specifications, records)

### Audit Checklist Development
**Essential elements:**
- **BRCGS clause references** for each requirement being checked
- **Specific questions** to verify implementation
- **Evidence requirements** to support conformance
- **Space for observations** and notes
- **Non-conformance recording** capability

## Conducting Effective Audits

### Opening Meeting
**Establish audit framework:**
- **Confirm audit scope** and objectives
- **Introduce audit team** and roles
- **Explain audit process** and timeframes
- **Request cooperation** and access to records
- **Address questions** or concerns

### Information Gathering Techniques

#### Observation
**What to observe:**
- **Work practices** compared to documented procedures
- **Equipment condition** and maintenance status
- **Hygiene practices** and environmental conditions
- **Record keeping** and documentation practices

**Observation skills:**
- **Watch complete processes** from start to finish
- **Note deviations** from documented requirements
- **Look for evidence** of systematic problems
- **Avoid interrupting** normal operations unnecessarily

#### Interviewing
**Effective questioning techniques:**
- **Open questions:** "How do you..." "What happens when..."
- **Specific questions:** "Show me the procedure for..."
- **Follow-up questions:** "Why is that important?" "What if...?"
- **Avoid leading questions:** Don't suggest the answer you want

**Interview best practices:**
- **Put people at ease** - auditing is not fault-finding
- **Listen actively** to understand real situations
- **Ask for examples** of how procedures work in practice
- **Verify understanding** by summarising what you heard

#### Document Review
**Key documents to examine:**
- **Policies and procedures** for current versions
- **Training records** for competency evidence
- **Monitoring records** for compliance trends
- **Corrective action records** for effectiveness
- **Customer communications** for satisfaction evidence

### Evidence Collection
**What constitutes valid evidence:**
- **Objective facts** that can be verified
- **Multiple sources** supporting the same conclusion
- **Representative sampling** across time periods and activities
- **Clear documentation** of what was observed or reviewed

**Evidence recording:**
- **Specific details:** Date, time, location, people involved
- **Factual observations:** What you saw, not interpretations
- **Document references:** Procedure numbers, record dates
- **Photo evidence:** If appropriate and permitted

## Identifying and Classifying Non-Conformances

### Types of Non-Conformances
**Major non-conformance:**
- **Absence or failure** of a system requirement
- **Systematic breakdown** of implemented system
- **Significant risk** to product safety or legality
- **Multiple related minor** non-conformances indicating system failure

**Minor non-conformance:**
- **Isolated incident** or deviation
- **System exists** but some implementation weakness
- **Limited impact** on product safety or quality
- **Single occurrence** without systematic pattern

### BRCGS-Specific Considerations
**Fundamental requirements:**
- **Any non-conformance** against fundamental requirements is major
- **Critical to certification** - must be fully resolved
- **Examples:** HACCP system, management commitment, prerequisite programmes

**Assessment criteria:**
- **Risk to Product Safety** - highest priority
- **Customer impact** - could affect customer satisfaction
- **Regulatory compliance** - legal requirement issues
- **System effectiveness** - does the system achieve objectives

## Documentation and Reporting

### Recording Findings
**Non-conformance documentation:**
- **Clear statement** of the problem observed
- **BRCGS clause reference** that is not being met
- **Objective evidence** supporting the finding
- **Risk assessment** of potential impact
- **Recommended timeframe** for correction

### Audit Report Structure
**Executive summary:** Key findings and overall assessment
**Audit details:** Scope, dates, auditors, areas covered
**Findings summary:** Major and minor non-conformances listed
**Positive observations:** Areas of good practice
**Recommendations:** Suggestions for improvement
**Follow-up requirements:** Timescales for corrective actions

### Closing Meeting
**Present findings:**
- **Explain each non-conformance** with supporting evidence
- **Discuss severity** and classification rationale
- **Agree timescales** for corrective action
- **Confirm understanding** of requirements
- **Plan follow-up** audit activities

## Follow-up and Verification

### Corrective Action Review
