## Why Personal Hygiene Matters

Personal hygiene in a packaging factory isn't just about looking professional - it's about protecting the food that goes into our packaging. Poor hygiene can introduce harmful bacteria, foreign objects, or contamination that could make people ill.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (6.2.1):** Documented personal hygiene requirements must be communicated to all personnel based on risk assessment.

**Kangopak Standard:** Training in Personal Hygiene Standard Practices is mandatory annual refresher training for all staff.

## Personal Hygiene Requirements

### Hair and Head Covering
- **Hair nets/hats:** Must cover all hair completely - no loose strands visible
