## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What are the five levels in the hierarchy of controls, and when would you use each?**
   - Answer: Elimination (remove hazard completely), Engineering (physical barriers/automation), Administrative (procedures/training), PPE (personal protection), Monitoring (verification) - use highest level feasible for each situation

2. **How do you determine if a control point is a Critical Control Point (CCP)?**
   - Answer: Use HACCP decision tree - is there a significant hazard? Is this the only step that can control it? Can monitoring detect loss of control? Is corrective action possible?

3. **What elements should be included in advanced root cause analysis?**
   - Answer: Multiple analysis methods (5 Why, fishbone, etc.), human factors assessment, statistical analysis of patterns, system-wide impact evaluation, validation of corrective measures
