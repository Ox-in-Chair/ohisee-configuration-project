**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Document Control Procedure

# Document Control Training

**Module:** Document Control Training  
**Audience:** All personnel who use controlled documents, supervisors, document controllers  
**BRCGS Reference:** 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.4  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 3.2 BRC Document Control Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** controlled documents and understand why document control is essential for product safety
2. **Access** current versions of procedures and work instructions correctly
3. **Recognise** obsolete documents and understand the risks of using outdated information
4. **Follow** proper procedures for document changes and updates

## Why Document Control Matters

Document control ensures everyone is working to the same standards and using the most current information. Using outdated procedures can lead to product safety risks, quality problems, regulatory non-compliance, and potentially dangerous situations.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (3.2.1):** The company shall have a procedure to manage documents which form part of the product safety and quality management system.

**Kangopak Standard:** All controlled documents must be managed through the document control system to ensure only current versions are used in operational areas.

## Understanding Controlled Documents

### What Are Controlled Documents?
Controlled documents are official company documents that:
- **Affect product safety or quality** - procedures that impact our packaging
- **Require consistency** - everyone must follow the same method
- **Change over time** - need regular updates and revisions
- **Must be traceable** - we need to know who uses what version when

### Types of Controlled Documents at Kangopak:
**Procedures and Policies:**
- **BRCGS procedures** - all procedures referenced in BRCGS standard
- **Work instructions** - specific job methods and processes
- **Safety procedures** - health and safety requirements
- **Emergency procedures** - incident response and evacuation

**Technical Documents:**
- **Product specifications** - what our packaging must achieve
- **Process parameters** - critical settings and measurements
- **Quality control procedures** - testing and inspection methods
- **Equipment manuals** - operation and maintenance instructions

**Forms and Records:**
- **Controlled forms** - standard formats for recording information
- **Checklists** - ensure all steps are completed
- **Inspection sheets** - quality and safety check templates

### What Are NOT Controlled Documents:
- **General reference materials** - industry standards, catalogues
- **Personal notes** - individual reminders or calculations
- **Draft documents** - work in progress, not yet approved
- **External documents** - supplier literature, government publications

## Document Control System (BRCGS 3.2.1)

### Key Components:
**Document Register/List:**
- **Master list** of all controlled documents
- **Current version numbers** for each document
- **Issue dates** and review dates
- **Distribution lists** - who receives each document

**Version Control:**
- **Unique identifiers** - document numbers and version numbers
- **Change tracking** - what changed between versions
- **Approval records** - who approved each version
- **Implementation dates** - when new versions take effect

### Document Identification:
All controlled documents have:
- **Document number** (e.g., PROC-3.2-18)
- **Title** (e.g., "BRC Document Control Procedure")
- **Version/revision number** (e.g., Rev 18)
- **Issue date** (when this version was released)
- **Review date** (when next review is due)
- **Approval signatures** (quality manager, technical manager)

## Accessing Current Documents (BRCGS 3.2.2)

### Where to Find Current Documents:
**Electronic systems:**
- **Company intranet** - searchable document database
- **Production area terminals** - relevant procedures available locally
- **Mobile devices** - approved apps with document access
- **Email distribution** - notifications of new versions

**Physical copies:**
- **Controlled copy locations** - designated areas with current versions
- **Work area displays** - key procedures posted where used
- **Supervisor copies** - team leaders have procedure sets
- **Training room** - copies for training purposes

### How to Check You Have Current Version:
1. **Check the document register** - verify version number matches
2. **Look for "CURRENT" stamp** - on physical copies
3. **Electronic timestamps** - system shows last update
4. **Ask your supervisor** - if unsure about document status

### Your Responsibilities:
- **Use only current versions** - never use outdated documents
- **Report missing documents** - if procedures not available
- **Return obsolete copies** - don't keep old versions
- **Check regularly** - version numbers before starting work

## Managing Document Changes (BRCGS 3.2.3-3.2.4)

### Change Control Process:
**Step 1: Change Request**
- **Identify need** - process improvement, regulatory update, incident learning
- **Document request** - what needs changing and why
- **Initial approval** - supervisor or department head approval

**Step 2: Review and Approval**
- **Technical review** - ensure change is appropriate and safe
- **Risk assessment** - evaluate impact on product safety and quality
- **Final approval** - quality manager or designated authority

**Step 3: Implementation**
- **Document update** - prepare new version with clear change marking
- **Distribution** - issue new version to all relevant personnel
- **Training** - brief affected staff on changes
- **Remove old versions** - collect and destroy obsolete copies

### Communicating Changes:
**Change notices:**
- **Summary of changes** - what's different in new version
- **Reason for change** - why the update was necessary
- **Implementation date** - when new version takes effect
- **Training requirements** - any additional training needed

**Change markings:**
- **Highlighted text** - show exactly what changed
- **Revision clouds** - circles around changed sections
- **Change bars** - lines in margin showing updated areas
- **Summary tables** - list all changes in document header

## Record Keeping (BRCGS 3.2.4)

### What Records Must Be Kept:
- **Document approval records** - who approved each version
- **Distribution records** - who received each document
- **Training records** - who was trained on each procedure
- **Change history** - complete revision tracking
- **Obsolete document disposal** - proof old versions destroyed

### Record Retention:
- **Current procedures** - held until superseded
- **Superseded versions** - kept for defined period (usually 3 years)
- **Approval records** - permanent retention
- **Training records** - held per legal requirements
- **Distribution lists** - updated regularly, history maintained

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Document Control ✓
- **Version checking:** "I always check the document register before starting a new procedure"
- **Change awareness:** "I received the change notice and attended the briefing on the updated cleaning procedure"
- **Proper access:** "I use the terminal in my work area to access the current work instructions"
- **Reporting issues:** "I noticed a procedure was missing from our work area and reported it immediately"

### Poor Practices to Avoid ✗
- **Using old versions:** "I've got this procedure memorised, I don't need to check for updates"
- **Personal copies:** "I keep my own printed copy in my toolbox for convenience"
- **Ignoring changes:** "The changes don't affect my bit of the job, so I didn't read the notice"
- **Informal procedures:** "We've developed our own way of doing this that works better"

## Special Considerations

### Electronic Documents:
- **System access** - ensure you can log in to document systems
- **Software requirements** - needed programs installed and updated
- **Backup systems** - what to do if electronic systems fail
- **Printing controls** - when printing is allowed and how copies are controlled

### Multi-language Requirements:
- **Translation accuracy** - ensuring technical terms are correctly translated
- **Version synchronisation** - all language versions must be current
- **Cultural adaptation** - procedures adapted for local understanding
- **Training consistency** - same message delivered regardless of language

### External Documents:
- **Customer specifications** - how these are controlled and updated
- **Regulatory documents** - ensuring current legal requirements are followed
- **Supplier information** - managing technical data from suppliers
- **Industry standards** - maintaining current versions of reference standards

## Emergency Procedures

### When Document Systems Fail:
**Immediate actions:**
1. **Stop non-critical operations** that depend on document access
2. **Use backup systems** - paper copies, alternative terminals
3. **Notify management** - report system failure immediately
4. **Document workarounds** - record what alternative methods used

**Contingency measures:**
- **Emergency document packs** - critical procedures in hard copy
- **Supervisor guidance** - team leaders provide verbal instructions
- **Restricted operations** - continue only essential activities
- **System restoration** - IT support to restore normal operations

### Continuing Operations:
- **Risk assessment** - evaluate safety of continuing without full document access
- **Enhanced supervision** - increased management oversight during disruption
- **Record keeping** - maintain records of emergency procedures used
- **Post-incident review** - learn from system failure and improve resilience

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **How can you verify that you're using the current version of a procedure?**
   - Answer: Check the document register for current version number, look for "CURRENT" stamp on physical copies, check electronic timestamps, or ask supervisor

2. **What should you do if you find someone using an outdated procedure?**
   - Answer: Stop them immediately, help them access the current version, report to supervisor, ensure they understand any changes

3. **Name three types of records that must be kept for document control.**
   - Answer: Document approval records, distribution records, training records, change history, obsolete document disposal records (any three)
