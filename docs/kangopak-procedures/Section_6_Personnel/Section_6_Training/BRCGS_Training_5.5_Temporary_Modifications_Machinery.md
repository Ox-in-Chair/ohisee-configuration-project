**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Maintenance of Plant and Equipment

# Temporary Modifications to Machinery and Equipment Training

**Module:** Temporary Modifications to Machinery and Equipment  
**Audience:** Operators, packers, team leaders, and maintenance personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 6.1.4, 4.7 (Maintenance), 2.7.3  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.5 BRCGS Maintenance of Plant and Equipment

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** when a temporary modification is appropriate and safe
2. **Follow** proper documentation and approval procedures for temporary modifications
3. **Monitor** temporary modifications to ensure they remain safe and effective
4. **Schedule** permanent corrections through the maintenance job card system

## Why Temporary Modification Control Matters

Temporary modifications help keep production running while permanent repairs are planned. However, poorly managed temporary modifications can create safety hazards, contamination risks, or equipment damage.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (6.1.4):** Temporary modifications to machinery and equipment must be controlled to prevent contamination and ensure safety.

**Kangopak Standard:** All temporary modifications must be immediately documented, scheduled for correction, and monitored until permanent repairs are completed.

## What Are Temporary Modifications

### Definition
Temporary modifications are short-term changes made to production machinery to enable continued operation while permanent repairs are scheduled. They are intended to be removed as soon as possible.

### Common Examples at Kangopak
- **Safety guards:** Temporary replacement of damaged guards
- **Conveyor supports:** Additional brackets to support damaged conveyor sections
- **Emergency stops:** Temporary wiring repairs to safety systems
- **Product guides:** Makeshift guides to prevent product jams
- **Cleaning access:** Temporary covers for missing access panels

### What's NOT a Temporary Modification
- **Routine adjustments:** Normal setting changes during production
- **Preventive maintenance:** Scheduled maintenance activities
- **Product changeovers:** Standard equipment setup changes
- **Calibration:** Normal adjustment of measurement devices

## When Temporary Modifications Are Appropriate

### Acceptable Situations
- **Safety maintained:** Modification doesn't compromise safety systems
- **No contamination risk:** Product safety is not threatened
- **Equipment protection:** Prevents further damage while repairs are scheduled
- **Short term only:** Modification will be corrected within reasonable timeframe

### Unacceptable Situations
- **Safety compromised:** Any modification that reduces safety protection
- **Contamination risk:** Changes that could introduce foreign bodies or chemicals
- **Structural integrity:** Modifications that weaken equipment structure
- **Long-term use:** When permanent repair won't be done promptly

## Temporary Modification Procedures

### Immediate Documentation (During Production)
1. **Stop production safely:** Ensure equipment is in safe state
2. **Assess the need:** Determine if temporary modification is appropriate
3. **Document on production log:** Record in designated section immediately
4. **Include details:** Reason, date, expected duration, and description
5. **Raise maintenance job card:** Initiate MJC for permanent repair
6. **Record MJC number:** Cross-reference on production log

### Before Starting Next Job
1. **Check modification status:** Verify temporary modification is still in place
2. **Safety assessment:** Ensure modification hasn't deteriorated or shifted  
3. **Risk evaluation:** Confirm no contamination risk to new product
4. **Document verification:** Record check on production log sheet
5. **Supervisor sign-off:** Team leader or supervisor must verify and approve

### Job Completion Requirements
1. **Final status check:** Confirm if temporary modification was removed
2. **Document outcome:** Record whether permanent repair was completed
3. **MJC closure:** Verify maintenance job card was completed and signed
4. **Cross-reference:** Match MJC number with production log entries
5. **Supervisor verification:** Supervisor must confirm all documentation complete

## Documentation Requirements

### Production Log Sheet Entries
- **Modification description:** Clear explanation of what was changed
- **Date and time:** When modification was made
- **Reason:** Why the modification was necessary
- **Duration estimate:** How long modification expected to remain
- **MJC number:** Maintenance job card reference number
- **Operator initials:** Person who made the modification

### Maintenance Job Card System
- **Immediate initiation:** MJC must be raised when modification is made
- **Priority assignment:** Based on safety and production impact
- **Completion tracking:** Monitor progress of permanent repair
- **Closure verification:** Confirm work completed and tested

## Practical Factory Examples

### DO's ✓
- **Document immediately:** Write details on production log as soon as modification is made
- **Get supervision:** Have team leader review and approve temporary modifications
- **Monitor regularly:** Check modification remains secure throughout production run  
- **Schedule repairs:** Ensure maintenance job card is raised immediately
- **Communicate clearly:** Tell next shift about any temporary modifications

### DON'Ts ✗
- **Never ignore documentation:** All modifications must be recorded
- **Never compromise safety:** Don't modify safety guards or emergency systems
- **Never leave indefinitely:** Temporary modifications must be scheduled for correction
- **Never work without approval:** Get supervisor authorisation for modifications
- **Never assume it's safe:** Always assess contamination and safety risks

## Types of Temporary Modifications

### Mechanical Supports
- **Additional brackets:** Supporting damaged equipment sections
- **Temporary guards:** Replacing missing or damaged safety covers
- **Guide adjustments:** Makeshift product guides to prevent jams
- **Belt supports:** Additional support for worn conveyor belts

### Electrical/Control
- **Temporary wiring:** Emergency repairs to control circuits
- **Switch bypasses:** Temporary connection of failed switches (with safety assessment)
- **Sensor replacements:** Temporary sensors while permanent replacements ordered
- **Control modifications:** Temporary changes to control logic

### Safety Considerations
- **Never disable safety systems:** Safety interlocks must remain functional
- **Maintain emergency stops:** All emergency stop systems must work properly
- **Guard integrity:** Any temporary guards must provide equivalent protection
- **Access restrictions:** Maintain safe access to equipment and controls

## Monitoring and Review

### Ongoing Monitoring During Production
- **Regular checks:** Verify modification remains secure and effective
- **Safety validation:** Confirm no safety hazards have developed
- **Product safety:** Monitor for any contamination risks
- **Documentation:** Update production log if modification status changes

### Supervisor Responsibilities
- **Review and approval:** All temporary modifications must be supervisor-approved
- **Progress tracking:** Monitor maintenance job card progress
- **Safety oversight:** Ensure modifications don't compromise safety
- **Training compliance:** Verify operators follow proper procedures

### Maintenance Department Role
- **Prompt response:** Prioritise temporary modifications for permanent repair
- **Technical assessment:** Evaluate if temporary modification is appropriate
- **Completion verification:** Confirm permanent repairs are effective
- **Documentation closure:** Ensure all paperwork is completed

## What Happens When Procedures Aren't Followed

**Immediate consequences:**
- Production stopped until proper documentation completed
- Safety investigation if modification poses risks
- Non-conformance report and corrective action required

**Serious consequences:**
- Equipment failure due to inadequate temporary repairs
- Product contamination from poorly managed modifications
- Worker injury from unsafe temporary modifications
- Regulatory violations and potential legal action
