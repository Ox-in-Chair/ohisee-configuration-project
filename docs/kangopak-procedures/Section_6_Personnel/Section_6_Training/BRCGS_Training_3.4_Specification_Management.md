## Why Specification Management Is Critical

Specifications are the foundation of our product safety and quality system. They define exactly what we produce, how we produce it, and what our customers can expect. Poor specification management can lead to unsafe products, customer complaints, regulatory failures, and loss of certification.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (3.4 - FUNDAMENTAL):** Specifications shall be suitably detailed, accurate and compliant with relevant product safety and legislative requirements.

**Kangopak Standard:** All product and raw material specifications must be comprehensive, agreed with relevant parties, and regularly reviewed for continued suitability.

## Understanding Specifications (BRCGS 3.4.1)

### What Makes a Good Specification:
**Suitably detailed** - enough information to ensure consistent production:
- **Physical properties** - dimensions, weight, appearance, performance
- **Material composition** - raw materials used and their properties
- **Manufacturing parameters** - critical process conditions
- **Quality requirements** - acceptance criteria and testing methods
- **Packaging and labelling** - how products are presented
- **Storage and handling** - conditions needed to maintain quality

**Accurate** - information must be correct and up-to-date:
- **Verified data** - all information checked and validated
- **Current standards** - references to latest regulations and standards
- **Realistic targets** - achievable specifications based on process capability
- **Clear measurements** - unambiguous criteria and tolerances

**Compliant** - meeting all relevant requirements:
- **Food contact regulations** - migration limits, approved materials
- **Health and safety** - no harmful substances or unsafe designs
- **Environmental** - recyclability, sustainability requirements
- **Customer standards** - specific requirements from customers

### Functional Effect Claims:
When packaging provides functional benefits (BRCGS 3.4.1):
- **Shelf-life extension** - proven performance data required
- **Freshness maintenance** - test evidence of effectiveness
- **Temperature control** - verified performance under conditions
- **Barrier properties** - documented protection levels
- **Anti-microbial effects** - proven efficacy against specific organisms

**Documentation required:**
- **Independent testing** - third-party verification preferred
- **Performance data** - results under relevant conditions
- **Scientific evidence** - peer-reviewed studies where available
- **Regulatory approval** - where required for claims made

## Specification Agreements (BRCGS 3.4.2)

### Formal Agreement Process:
**Customer specifications:**
- **Written approval** from customer technical team

- **Reviewed regularly** - at defined frequencies or when changes occur
- **Updated when needed** - changes in materials, regulations, or products

### Review Triggers:
- **Material changes** - new suppliers or formulations
- **Regulatory updates** - new or revised legal requirements
- **Product modifications** - design or process changes
- **Customer requirements** - new specifications or standards
- **Incident learning** - issues identified in use

## Brand and Trademark Management (BRCGS 3.4.4)

### Logo and Trademark Control:
**Customer brands:**
- **Written permission** - formal agreement to use customer logos
- **Usage guidelines** - correct application, size, placement
- **Quality standards** - print quality and colour requirements
- **Security measures** - prevent unauthorised use

**Third-party trademarks:**
- **Licensing agreements** - proper authorisation for use
- **Compliance monitoring** - ensure terms are followed
- **Documentation** - maintain records of permissions
- **Regular review** - verify continued authorisation

### Brand Protection Measures:
- **Secure storage** - artwork and printing materials controlled
- **Access restrictions** - only authorised personnel handle branded materials
- **Destruction procedures** - safe disposal of rejected branded products
- **Audit trail** - complete traceability of branded product production

## Specification Change Control (BRCGS 3.4.5)

### Change Review Process:
**Triggers for review:**
- **Product composition changes** - new materials or formulations
- **Characteristic changes** - performance, appearance, or properties
- **Predetermined intervals** - regular scheduled reviews
- **Customer requests** - modifications to meet new requirements
- **Regulatory changes** - updates to legal requirements

**Review procedure:**
1. **Change evaluation** - assess impact on safety, quality, legality
2. **Risk assessment** - identify potential consequences
3. **Technical review** - verify feasibility and compliance
4. **Approval process** - appropriate authority signs off
5. **Implementation** - controlled introduction of changes

### Communication Requirements:
**Customer notification:**

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Specification Management ✓
- **Comprehensive detail:** "Our packaging specifications include all critical dimensions, materials, and performance requirements"
- **Customer agreement:** "We have signed specifications with all major customers, updated annually"
- **Change control:** "When regulations changed, we reviewed all affected specifications within 30 days"
- **Compliance documentation:** "All food contact materials have current compliance statements from qualified technical staff"

### Poor Practices to Avoid ✗
- **Incomplete specifications:** "We just specify the main requirements and assume everything else is obvious"
- **Informal agreements:** "Our customer knows what they want, we don't need formal specifications"
- **Delayed updates:** "We know the specification has changed but haven't updated the document yet"
- **Unqualified approval:** "Anyone can approve specification changes if the manager isn't available"

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Material Products:
- **Component specifications** - each material specified separately
- **Assembly requirements** - how components fit together
- **Interaction effects** - compatibility between materials
- **Testing protocols** - verification of complete product performance

### Regulatory Complexity:
- **Multiple jurisdictions** - different requirements in different markets
- **Evolving regulations** - keeping up with regulatory changes
- **Interpretation guidance** - understanding regulatory intent
- **Expert consultation** - when to seek specialist advice

### Customer Variations:
- **Custom specifications** - managing multiple variants efficiently
- **Standard offerings** - balancing customisation with standardisation
- **Version control** - avoiding confusion between customer-specific specs
- **Change coordination** - managing updates across multiple customers

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Specifications:
- **New products** - untested specifications or processes
- **Food contact applications** - higher regulatory requirements
- **Customer-specific requirements** - unique or demanding specifications
- **Multi-component products** - complex interactions to manage

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Prototype testing** - verify specifications before full production
- **Gradual implementation** - phased introduction of changes
- **Enhanced monitoring** - increased quality control during transitions
- **Contingency planning** - procedures for specification failures
