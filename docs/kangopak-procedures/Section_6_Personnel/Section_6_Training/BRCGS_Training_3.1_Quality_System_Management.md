**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Product Safety and Quality Management System

# Quality System Management Training

**Module:** Quality System Management  
**Audience:** Quality managers, department heads, system coordinators, senior technical staff  
**BRCGS Reference:** 3.1.1, 3.1.2  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 3.1 BRC Product Safety and Quality Management System

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Establish** and maintain an effective product safety and quality management system
2. **Implement** systematic review and improvement processes for the quality system
3. **Integrate** quality management with business operations and regulatory requirements

## Why Quality System Management Is Critical

A robust quality management system is the foundation of our BRCGS certification and business success. It ensures consistent product safety and quality, regulatory compliance, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement. Without effective system management, individual procedures become disconnected and less effective.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**
- 3.1.1: Effective product safety and quality management system implementation
- 3.1.2: Regular system review and improvement

**Kangopak Standard:** The quality system must be comprehensive, fully implemented, regularly reviewed, and continuously improved to maintain certification and meet customer expectations.
