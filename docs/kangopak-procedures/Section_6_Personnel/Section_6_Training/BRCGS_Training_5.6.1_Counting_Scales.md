**Kangopak Procedure:** Work Instruction: Setting and Operation of Counting Scales

# Operation and Setting Up of Counting Scales Training

**Module:** Operation and Setting Up of Counting Scales  
**Audience:** Operators, packers, and quality control personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 5.4.7, 5.5.3, 5.6.1  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.6.1 Work Instruction: Setting and Operation of Counting Scales

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Set up** counting scales correctly for different product batches and carton sizes
2. **Operate** counting scales safely and accurately to verify product quantities
3. **Record** scale readings properly on production logs and carton labels
4. **Identify** when scales require calibration or maintenance

## Why Counting Scales Matter

Counting scales ensure that customers receive the exact quantity they've ordered. Incorrect quantities can lead to customer complaints, costly product recalls, and damage to Kangopak's reputation.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (5.4.7):** Equipment such as counting scales must be specified where necessary to ensure product safety, legality, and quality.

**Kangopak Standard:** All finished goods cartons must be verified using counting scales before dispatch to ensure accurate product quantities.

## Types of Products Using Counting Scales

### Pouch Making Machines
- **Automatic counting:** Machines batch products in quantities of 50 or 100
- **HMI input:** Operator sets batch size on machine monitor
- **Carton verification:** Multiple batches placed in carton, then verified on counting scales

### Spout Inserter Machines
- **Manual counting:** Pouches counted by hand
- **Direct verification:** Counted pouches placed in carton and verified on scales
- **Higher accuracy need:** Manual counting requires more careful scale verification

## Setting Up Counting Scales

### Pre-Use Checks
1. **Visual inspection:** Check scales are clean and undamaged
2. **Power check:** Ensure scales are properly connected and powered on
3. **Display test:** Verify digital display is clear and functioning
4. **Zero point:** Confirm scales read zero when empty

### Calibration Verification
- **Daily checks:** Verify scales using known weight standards
- **Tolerance limits:** Check readings are within acceptable range
- **Out of service:** If readings are incorrect, stop use immediately and tag "OUT OF SERVICE"
- **Record keeping:** Document all calibration checks on verification forms

### Sample Weight Setup
1. **Count sample:** Accurately count 10 pieces of the product being packed
2. **Weigh sample:** Place sample on scales to establish unit weight
3. **Program scales:** Enter sample weight and quantity into scale memory
4. **Verify setup:** Test with known quantities before starting production

## Operating Counting Scales

### Step-by-Step Operation
1. **Prepare carton:** Place empty carton on scales and press "Tare" to zero
2. **Add product:** Place counted product batches into carton
3. **Read display:** Note the quantity shown on scale display
4. **Verify accuracy:** Compare scale count with expected quantity
5. **Record results:** Write carton weight and quantity on production log

### Recording Requirements
- **Production log:** Record carton number, weight, and your initials
- **Carton label:** Write weight on carton label for traceability
- **Discrepancies:** Report any quantity differences to team leader immediately

## Practical Factory Examples

### DO's ✓
- **Clean scales regularly:** Remove product debris and dust daily
- **Check zero point:** Verify scales read zero before each new product run
- **Use sample weights:** Always establish accurate sample weight for new products
- **Record immediately:** Write readings on logs straight away, don't rely on memory
- **Report problems:** Tell supervisor if scales give inconsistent readings

### DON'Ts ✗
- **Never ignore errors:** Don't proceed if scale readings don't match expected quantities
- **Never use damaged scales:** Stop work if scales are cracked or display is faulty
- **Never skip tare function:** Always zero scales with empty carton before adding product
- **Never estimate:** Don't guess product quantities if scales aren't working
- **Never use dirty scales:** Product residue can affect accuracy

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Scale Reading Too High/Low
- **Check sample weight:** Verify original sample count was accurate
- **Clean scale platform:** Remove any product debris or foreign material
- **Check environmental factors:** Drafts or vibration can affect readings
- **Verify calibration:** Use standard weights to check scale accuracy

### Inconsistent Readings
- **Stable placement:** Ensure carton sits squarely on scale platform
- **Allow settling time:** Wait for reading to stabilise before recording
- **Check for interference:** Move away from vibrating machinery
- **Temperature effects:** Allow scales to warm up after being switched on

### Display Problems
- **Check connections:** Ensure power and data cables are secure
- **Clean display:** Wipe screen with soft, dry cloth
- **Reset scales:** Turn off and restart if display freezes
- **Call maintenance:** Report persistent display issues immediately

## What Happens When Things Go Wrong

**Immediate consequences:**
- Production stopped until scale issues resolved
- Potential over/under packing of customer orders
- Quality hold on affected products

**Serious consequences:**
- Customer complaints about incorrect quantities
- Financial losses from over-packing products
- Legal issues if products are under-packed
- Loss of customer trust and future orders

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What must you do before placing product on counting scales?**
   - Answer: Place empty carton on scales and press "Tare" to zero the display

2. **How do you establish the unit weight for a new product?**
   - Answer: Accurately count 10 pieces, weigh the sample, and program the weight into the scales

3. **What should you do if scales give inconsistent readings?**
   - Answer: Stop using scales, tag as "OUT OF SERVICE", and report to supervisor immediately

4. **Where must you record scale readings?**
   - Answer: On the production log sheet with carton number and your initials, plus on the carton label

## Simple Practical Activity (15 minutes)

**Counting Scales Setup Exercise:**

1. **Setup demonstration:** Trainer shows proper scale setup using sample product
2. **Practice session:** Each participant sets up scales for different product types
3. **Recording practice:** Complete production log entries with dummy data
4. **Problem identification:** Review common scale problems using examples
5. **Troubleshooting:** Discuss what to do when scales malfunction

## Maintenance and Calibration

### Daily Requirements
- **Visual inspection:** Check for damage or wear
- **Cleaning:** Remove product residue with appropriate cleaning materials
- **Zero check:** Verify scales read zero when empty
- **Function test:** Confirm all buttons and display work properly

### Calibration Schedule
- **External calibration:** Professional calibration every 12 months
- **Internal verification:** Daily checks using standard weights
- **After maintenance:** Full calibration after any repairs
- **New installation:** Complete calibration before first use

### When to Stop Using Scales
- Failed calibration or verification check
- Damage to scale platform or display
- Inconsistent or drifting readings
- Missing or expired calibration sticker
- Any malfunction that affects accuracy

## Documentation Requirements

**Training records:** Your completion of this training must be recorded and signed
**Competency assessment:** Supervisor must verify you can operate scales correctly
**Ongoing monitoring:** Scale operation checked during routine quality audits
**Deviation reporting:** Any scale problems must be documented on non-conformance forms
