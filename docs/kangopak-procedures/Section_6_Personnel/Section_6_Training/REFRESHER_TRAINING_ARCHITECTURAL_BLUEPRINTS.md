## ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### REFRESHER TRAINING DIFFERENTIATION MANDATE
Refresher modules are architecturally distinct from initial annual training with the following core principles:

**COMPETENCY VERIFICATION vs INITIAL LEARNING**
- Initial Training: "Learn how to do this correctly"
- Refresher Training: "Demonstrate you can still do this correctly"

**DURATION OPTIMIZATION**
- Initial Training: 90-180 minutes comprehensive learning
- Refresher Training: 30-90 minutes competency verification

**DELIVERY METHOD**
- Initial Training: 50% theory, 50% practical demonstration
- Refresher Training: 30% theory refresh, 70% practical assessment

**ASSESSMENT APPROACH**
- Initial Training: Knowledge acquisition + basic competency demonstration
- Refresher Training: Performance-based observation + scenario response
