**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Hazard and Risk Management Procedure

# Hazard & Risk Awareness for Production Personnel Training

**Module:** Hazard & Risk Awareness for Production Personnel  
**Audience:** All production personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 1.1.2, 2.1.1  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 1.1.1 Product Safety Culture Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between hazards and risks in packaging production environments
2. **Identify** common hazards that could affect product safety in your work area
3. **Apply** basic risk assessment thinking to everyday work situations

## Understanding Hazards and Risks

### What Is a Hazard?
A hazard is anything that **could** cause harm. In packaging production, hazards are everywhere - but that doesn't mean they will cause harm.

**Examples of hazards:**
- Sharp cutting blades on machines
- Cleaning chemicals
- Hot surfaces on equipment
- Moving machinery parts

### What Is Risk?
Risk is the **chance** that a hazard will actually cause harm, and how serious that harm might be.

**Risk = Likelihood × Severity**

**Key BRCGS Requirement (2.1.1):** HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) team must be competent and experienced.

**Kangopak Requirement:** Personnel understanding of hazards associated with duties, basic scientific and technical information, and "why we do things."

## Common Hazards in Packaging Production

### Physical Hazards
**What they are:** Objects or conditions that could physically contaminate packaging
- **Metal fragments** from worn equipment
- **Glass or plastic pieces** from broken components
- **Debris** from maintenance activities
- **Personal items** like buttons, jewellery, or hair

**Risk level:** HIGH - could cause choking or injury to consumers

### Chemical Hazards
**What they are:** Chemical substances that shouldn't be in product packaging
- **Cleaning chemical residues** not properly rinsed
- **Lubricants** from machinery leaking onto packaging
- **Ink or adhesives** applied incorrectly
- **Sanitiser overspray** on product-contact surfaces

**Risk level:** VARIES - from mild irritation to serious poisoning

### Biological Hazards
**What they are:** Living organisms that could make products unsafe
- **Bacteria** from poor hygiene practices
- **Mould** from damp or dirty conditions
- **Pests** like insects or rodents
- **Cross-contamination** from ill workers

**Risk level:** HIGH - could cause serious product safety issues

### Allergen Hazards
**What they are:** Allergen substances in areas where they shouldn't be
- **Cross-contact** from previous production runs
- **Cleaning failures** leaving allergen residues
- **Raw material mix-ups** using wrong specifications
- **Label errors** with incorrect allergen information

**Risk level:** VERY HIGH - could be fatal for allergic consumers

## Risk Assessment Thinking

### Step 1: What Could Go Wrong?
Look at your work area and think:
- What hazards are present?
- How could they affect the packaging?
- What might cause equipment to malfunction?
- What human errors are possible?

### Step 2: How Likely Is It?
Consider the probability:
- **Very likely** (happens regularly)
- **Possible** (has happened before)
- **Unlikely** (rare but possible)
- **Very unlikely** (almost impossible)

### Step 3: How Serious Would It Be?
Think about consequences:
- **Minor** - small quality issue, easy to fix
- **Moderate** - might affect customer satisfaction
- **Serious** - could harm consumers or require product recall
- **Severe** - could cause serious illness or death

### Step 4: What Controls Are Needed?
Determine what actions reduce the risk:
- **Eliminate** the hazard completely
- **Control** the hazard with procedures
- **Detect** problems before they reach customers
- **Respond** quickly when problems occur

## Practical Factory Examples

### Physical Hazard Scenarios
**Scenario:** Cutting blade shows signs of wear
- **Hazard:** Metal fragments could contaminate packaging
- **Risk assessment:** Moderate likelihood, serious consequences
- **Action:** Stop production, replace blade, check recent production

**Scenario:** Worker's button comes loose
- **Hazard:** Button could fall into packaging
- **Risk assessment:** Low likelihood, serious consequences
- **Action:** Check uniform daily, report damage immediately

### Chemical Hazard Scenarios
**Scenario:** Cleaning chemical spill near production line
- **Hazard:** Chemical residue on packaging surfaces
- **Risk assessment:** High likelihood if not cleaned properly, serious consequences
- **Action:** Stop production, clean thoroughly, test surfaces before restart

**Scenario:** Machine lubricant leak
- **Hazard:** Oil contamination of packaging materials
- **Risk assessment:** Moderate likelihood, moderate to serious consequences
- **Action:** Fix leak, quarantine affected product, clean area

### Biological Hazard Scenarios
**Scenario:** Damp patch on factory floor
- **Hazard:** Mould growth, bacterial contamination
- **Risk assessment:** High likelihood in damp conditions, serious consequences
- **Action:** Dry area immediately, investigate source, improve ventilation

**Scenario:** Pest droppings found near storage area
- **Hazard:** Bacterial contamination, physical contamination
- **Risk assessment:** High likelihood of spread, serious consequences
- **Action:** Clean area, report to pest control, check all nearby stock

## Why Understanding Hazards Helps You

### Better Decision Making
- **Spot problems early** before they become serious
- **Prioritise actions** based on risk level
- **Understand procedures** - why certain steps are required
- **Communicate effectively** with supervisors about concerns

### Personal Safety
- **Protect yourself** from workplace hazards
- **Work more confidently** knowing how to assess risks
- **Make safer choices** in your daily tasks
- **Help colleagues** understand risks too

### Product Safety
- **Prevent contamination** before it happens
- **Maintain quality** through risk awareness
- **Protect consumers** by understanding consequences
- **Support company reputation** through diligent work

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What's the difference between a hazard and a risk?**
   - Answer: Hazard is something that could cause harm; risk is the chance it will cause harm and how serious that harm might be

2. **A cleaning chemical spill happens near your work area. What type of hazard is this and what should you do?**
   - Answer: Chemical hazard - stop work, report immediately, don't restart until area properly cleaned and tested

3. **Why is risk assessment thinking important for your daily work?**
   - Answer: Helps spot problems early, make better decisions, understand why procedures exist, and protect both workers and consumers

## Simple Practical Activity (10 minutes)

**Hazard Hunt Exercise:**

1. **Walk around your work area** (real or simulated)
2. **List five potential hazards** you can see
3. **Classify each hazard** as physical, chemical, biological, or allergen
4. **Assess the risk level** for each (low, medium, high)
5. **Discuss control measures** already in place for each hazard
6. **Identify improvements** - what could reduce risks further?

**Group Discussion:**
- Share your findings with others
- Compare different perspectives on the same hazards
- Discuss why people might assess risks differently
- Talk about how to report hazards you discover

## What Supervisors Look For

Your supervisor will assess:

- **Observation skills** - ability to spot potential hazards
- **Risk thinking** - understanding likelihood and consequences
- **Communication** - reporting hazards and concerns appropriately
- **Procedure understanding** - knowing why safety steps are important
- **Improvement mindset** - suggesting ways to reduce risks
- **Consistency** - applying risk awareness throughout your shift

**HARA Team:** Some personnel may be selected for the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment team based on demonstrated competence.
