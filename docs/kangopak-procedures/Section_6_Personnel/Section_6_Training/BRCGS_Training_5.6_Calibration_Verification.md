**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Calibration Procedure

# Calibration & Verification of Measuring Devices Training

**Module:** Calibration & Verification of Measuring Devices  
**Audience:** Equipment operators and technical personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 5.5.3  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.6 BRCGS Calibration Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** why calibration and verification are essential for maintaining product quality and safety
2. **Perform** basic verification checks on measuring equipment according to documented procedures
3. **Recognise** when measuring devices are out of calibration and take appropriate corrective action

## Why Calibration Matters

Calibration ensures that measuring equipment gives accurate readings. Without accurate measurements, we cannot control our processes properly, which could lead to products that don't meet specifications and potentially unsafe packaging for product contact.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (5.5.3):** Measuring equipment shall be checked and adjusted by trained personnel at a predetermined frequency based on risk.

**Kangopak Requirement:** Trained personnel check and adjust measuring equipment quarterly, bi-annually, or annually based on risk assessment, using defined methods.

## Understanding Calibration vs Verification

### What Is Calibration?
**Calibration** is the process of comparing a measuring instrument against a known standard and adjusting it if necessary to ensure accuracy.

**Professional calibration involves:**
- **Comparison** against certified reference standards
- **Adjustment** if measurements are outside acceptable limits
- **Documentation** of results and any adjustments made
- **Certification** that the instrument meets accuracy requirements

### What Is Verification?
**Verification** is checking that calibrated equipment is still working accurately between formal calibration events.

**User verification includes:**
- **Simple checks** using check standards or test pieces
- **Comparison** of readings against known values
- **Recording** results to track performance
- **Action** if verification shows problems

### Why Both Are Needed
**Calibration:** Ensures instruments start accurate and stay accurate over time
**Verification:** Catches problems between calibrations so they don't affect product quality
**Together:** Provide confidence that all measurements are reliable and trustworthy

## Types of Measuring Equipment

## Calibration Frequency and Risk

### Risk-Based Approach
**High risk equipment (quarterly calibration):**
- **Critical process control** measurements
- **Customer complaint history** with measurement issues
- **Heavy usage** or harsh operating conditions
- **Legal or regulatory** measurement requirements

**Medium risk equipment (bi-annual calibration):**
- **Important quality** measurements
- **Moderate usage** in normal conditions
- **Some customer** specification requirements
- **Backup or secondary** measurement devices

**Lower risk equipment (annual calibration):**
- **General purpose** measurements
- **Light usage** or protected environment
- **Internal quality** control only
- **Non-critical** process measurements

### Factors Affecting Calibration Frequency
**Usage intensity:** More frequent use requires more frequent calibration
**Environmental conditions:** Heat, vibration, humidity affect accuracy
**Accuracy requirements:** Tighter tolerances need more frequent checking
**Equipment age:** Older equipment may drift more quickly
**Maintenance history:** Well-maintained equipment stays accurate longer

## Verification Procedures

### Daily Verification Checks
**Before using measuring equipment:**
1. **Check calibration status** - is calibration current?
2. **Visual inspection** - any obvious damage or wear?
3. **Zero check** - does instrument read zero correctly?
4. **Range check** - use check standard if available
5. **Function test** - do all controls work properly?

### Using Check Standards
**What are check standards:**
- **Known reference values** for verifying instrument accuracy
- **Traceable standards** certified for accuracy
- **Specific to each instrument type** and measurement range

**How to use check standards:**
1. **Clean instrument** and check standard
2. **Allow stabilisation** time for temperature equilibration
3. **Take measurement** using normal operating procedure
4. **Compare result** to certified value on check standard
5. **Record difference** and assess acceptability

### Recording Verification Results
**What to document:**
- **Date and time** of verification
- **Equipment identification** number or description
- **Check standard used** with certified value
- **Measured value** obtained during verification
- **Difference** between measured and certified values
- **Your name/initials** as person performing check
- **Action taken** if verification failed

## When Verification Fails

### Recognising Problems
**Signs that equipment needs attention:**
- **Readings outside** acceptable tolerance from check standard
- **Inconsistent results** when measuring the same item repeatedly
- **Physical damage** visible on instrument
- **Controls not working** properly
- **Display problems** or error messages

### Immediate Actions
**When verification shows problems:**
1. **Stop using the equipment** immediately
2. **Mark as "OUT OF SERVICE"** to prevent others using it
3. **Secure any products** measured since last successful verification
4. **Report problem** to supervisor or maintenance team
5. **Document the failure** with details of what was wrong

### Investigation and Resolution
**What happens next:**
- **Technical assessment** of the problem
- **Product impact evaluation** - could measurements have been wrong?
- **Repair or replacement** of faulty equipment
- **Re-calibration** once repairs are completed
- **Product disposition** decision for items measured with faulty equipment
