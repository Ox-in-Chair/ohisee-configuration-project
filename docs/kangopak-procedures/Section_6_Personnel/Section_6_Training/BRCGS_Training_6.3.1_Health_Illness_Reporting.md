**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Personal Hygiene Standard

# Health & Illness Reporting for Product Safety Training

**Module:** Health & Illness Reporting for Product Safety  
**Audience:** All factory personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 6.4.1  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 6.3.1 BRCGS Personal Hygiene Standard

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Recognise** symptoms of infection, disease, or conditions that could affect product safety
2. **Report** health issues appropriately and promptly to designated personnel
3. **Understand** why health reporting protects both consumers and your colleagues

## Why Health Reporting Matters

Some illnesses can be passed through product packaging, especially if you handle packaging materials while you're unwell. Reporting health issues isn't about getting in trouble - it's about keeping everyone safe and making sure our packaging doesn't make families ill.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (6.4.1):** Personnel must be aware of symptoms of infection, disease or conditions that would prevent them working in contact with the product.

**Kangopak Requirement:** Health symptoms are communicated during induction and refresher training, with information displayed on Personal Hygiene Standard posters.

## Symptoms You Must Report Immediately

### Digestive System Issues
- **Diarrhoea or vomiting** - even if mild or only happened once
- **Stomach cramps** with nausea or fever
- **Product safety symptoms** - even if you think it's over
- **Diagnosed gastroenteritis** or similar digestive illness

### Respiratory Symptoms
- **Persistent coughing** that produces sputum or mucus
- **Severe cold** with runny nose and sneezing
- **Flu-like symptoms** including fever and body aches
- **Diagnosed respiratory infections** like bronchitis

### Skin and Wound Issues
- **Open cuts or wounds** on hands, arms, or any exposed skin
- **Infected wounds** with pus, redness, or swelling
- **Skin infections** like impetigo or infected eczema
- **Burns or injuries** that haven't healed properly

### Other Conditions
- **Eye infections** with discharge or severe irritation
- **Diagnosed communicable diseases** like hepatitis, tuberculosis
- **High fever** from any cause
- **Any condition** where your doctor has advised you not to work

## How to Report Health Issues

### Step 1: Don't Come to Work
- **Stay home** if you have symptoms - don't try to "push through"
- **Call your supervisor** or the factory as early as possible
- **Be honest** about your symptoms - we can't help if we don't know
- **Get medical advice** if symptoms are severe or persistent

### Step 2: Provide Clear Information
- **What symptoms** you're experiencing
- **When they started** and how severe they are
- **Any medical diagnosis** if you've seen a doctor
- **Expected duration** if known

### Step 3: Follow Instructions
- **Wait for clearance** before returning to work
- **Provide medical certificate** if requested
- **Consider alternative duties** if available and appropriate
- **Report any changes** in your condition

### Step 4: Return to Work Safely
- **Full recovery** before handling product-contact materials
- **Medical clearance** if required
- **Hand hygiene check** to ensure you can maintain standards
- **Supervisor assessment** of fitness for normal duties

## Alternative Work Options

When you're not well enough for product-contact work, you might be able to:

### Non-Product Contact Areas
- **Administrative tasks** away from production
- **Maintenance areas** not connected to product packaging
- **Training activities** that don't involve production
- **Quality office work** if appropriate

### Modified Duties
- **Reduced responsibilities** while you recover
- **Different work area** with lower contamination risk
- **Shorter shifts** if fatigue is an issue
- **Desk-based activities** instead of production work

## Understanding the Risks

### To Consumers
- **Product safety illness** from contaminated packaging
- **Serious health consequences** especially for vulnerable people
- **Loss of trust** in product safety
- **Legal consequences** for the company

### To Colleagues
- **Spread of illness** throughout the workplace
- **Disruption to operations** if many people become ill
- **Stress and worry** about their own health
- **Additional workload** to cover for sick colleagues

### To Kangopak
- **Customer complaints** and potential loss of business
- **Regulatory investigation** by product safety authorities
- **BRCGS certification** at risk
- **Reputation damage** that takes years to repair

## Practical Factory Examples

### Correct Reporting ✓
- **Monday morning:** "I had diarrhoea yesterday evening and this morning - I'm staying home until it stops completely"
- **Before shift:** "I have a heavy cold with a runny nose - can I work in the office today instead?"
- **Cut finger:** "I cut my finger at home and it's still bleeding - I need to get it properly dressed before I handle packaging"
- **Family illness:** "My child has sickness and diarrhoea - should I stay home to avoid bringing germs in?"

### Incorrect Approach ✗
- **Hiding symptoms:** Coming to work with mild diarrhoea thinking "it's not that bad"
- **Working through illness:** "I can't afford to take time off so I'll just be extra careful"
- **Self-diagnosis:** "It's just a stomach upset from something I ate - it will pass"
- **Partial disclosure:** Not mentioning that you were sick yesterday but feel better today

2. **What should you do if you cut your finger badly at home?**
   - Answer: Report to supervisor immediately, get proper medical treatment, ensure wound is properly covered before handling any packaging

3. **Your family member has product safety concerns. What should you consider?**

## Simple Practical Activity (5 minutes)

**Symptom Recognition Exercise:**

1. **Scenario cards** - trainer presents different health situations
2. **Quick decisions** - should this person work today? Report? See alternative duties?
3. **Discussion** - why might someone hesitate to report these symptoms?
4. **Role play** - practice making the phone call to report illness
5. **Question time** - clarify any concerns about the reporting process

**Examples:**
- Mild headache but otherwise fine
- Scratched hand that won't stop bleeding
- Family member with stomach flu
- Heavy cold with blocked nose

## What Supervisors Look For

- **Honest communication** - giving full information about symptoms
- **Responsibility** - not coming to work when you shouldn't
