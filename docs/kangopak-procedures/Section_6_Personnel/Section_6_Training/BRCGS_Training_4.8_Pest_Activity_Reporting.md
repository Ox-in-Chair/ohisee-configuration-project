**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Pest Control

# Pest Activity Recognition & Reporting Training

**Module:** Pest Activity Recognition & Reporting  
**Audience:** All factory personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 4.11.8  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 4.8 BRCGS Pest Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Recognise** common signs of pest activity in packaging production environments
2. **Report** pest activity promptly to designated personnel using correct procedures
3. **Understand** why pest control is critical for food packaging safety and customer confidence

## Why Pest Control Matters

Pests can contaminate packaging materials with bacteria, droppings, urine, hair, and dead insects. They can also physically damage packaging and create Product Safety risks for consumers. Early detection and reporting prevents small problems becoming major infestations.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (4.11.8):** Personnel must understand signs of pest activity and the need to report evidence to a designated person.

**Kangopak Requirement:** All personnel trained to recognise signs of pest activity and report as an incident on a Non Conformance Advice (NCA).

## Common Pests in Food Packaging Facilities

### Rodents (Rats and Mice)
**What they look like:**
- **Mice:** Small (6-10cm), grey-brown, pointed nose, large ears
- **Rats:** Larger (15-25cm), grey-brown, blunt nose, smaller ears relative to body size

**Why they're dangerous:**
- Carry diseases like Salmonella and E. coli
- Contaminate surfaces with urine and droppings
- Gnaw through packaging materials
- Create very serious Product Safety risks

### Flying Insects
**Common types:**
- **Flies:** House flies, fruit flies, drain flies
- **Moths:** Flour moths, grain moths
- **Wasps and bees:** Attracted to sweet residues

**Why they're problematic:**
- Land on packaging and transfer bacteria
- Can get trapped in packaging materials
- Indicate sanitation or waste management issues
- Create customer complaints if found in products

### Crawling Insects
**Common types:**
- **Cockroaches:** Brown or black, fast-moving, hide in dark places
- **Ants:** Various sizes and colours, travel in trails
- **Beetles:** Various types attracted to food residues

**Why they're concerning:**
- Carry bacteria and contaminate surfaces
- Hide in equipment and multiply quickly
- Very difficult to eliminate once established
- Indicate moisture or cleanliness issues

### Birds
**Common problems:**
- **Pigeons, sparrows, starlings** entering through open doors or damaged areas
- **Nesting** in roof spaces or external areas
- **Droppings** on external packaging or equipment

**Risks they create:**
- Droppings carry diseases like Salmonella
- Feathers and nesting materials as foreign bodies
- Damage to building structures
- Create unsanitary external environment

## Signs of Pest Activity to Look For

### Rodent Signs
**Droppings:**
- **Mouse droppings:** Small (3-6mm), dark, pointed ends
- **Rat droppings:** Larger (12-18mm), dark, blunt ends
- **Fresh droppings:** Soft, dark, moist
- **Old droppings:** Hard, grey, crumbly

**Other signs:**
- **Gnaw marks** on packaging, cables, or wood
- **Grease marks** along walls where they travel
- **Scratching noises** in walls or ceilings, especially at night
- **Strong ammonia smell** from urine in enclosed areas
- **Nests** made from shredded materials

### Insect Signs
**Live insects:**
- **Flying insects** around lights, windows, or waste areas
- **Crawling insects** in corners, under equipment, or in storage areas
- **Dead insects** on windowsills, in light fittings, or on floors

**Evidence of activity:**
- **Insect parts** - legs, wings, body segments
- **Larvae or pupae** in stored materials or quiet areas
- **Unusual smells** from insect activity or dead insects
- **Damage to packaging** from chewing insects

### Bird Signs
**External evidence:**
- **Bird droppings** on walkways, loading areas, or equipment
- **Nests** under eaves, in roof spaces, or on equipment
- **Feathers** around building entrances or in storage areas
- **Dead birds** that need immediate removal

## How to Report Pest Activity

### Step 1: Don't Disturb the Evidence
- **Take a photo** if safe to do so (but don't handle anything)
- **Note the exact location** and time you found it
- **Don't clean up** droppings or dead insects until told to
- **Secure the area** if necessary to prevent contamination

### Step 2: Report Immediately
**Who to contact:**
- **Your supervisor** or line manager
- **Quality department** personnel
- **Designated pest control coordinator**
- **Anyone authorised to take Non Conformance Advice (NCA)**

**Information to provide:**
- **What you found** (droppings, insects, damage, etc.)
- **Exact location** (building, room, near which equipment)
- **When you found it** (date and time)
- **How much** (quantity of droppings, number of insects)
- **Your contact details** in case more information is needed

### Step 3: Follow Instructions
- **Wait for guidance** before cleaning or moving anything
- **Complete NCA form** if requested
- **Cooperate with investigation** by providing additional information
- **Follow any restrictions** on your work area until resolved

### Step 4: Prevention Actions
- **Check other areas** nearby for similar signs
- **Review recent activities** that might have attracted pests
- **Look for entry points** like gaps, holes, or open doors
- **Report maintenance needs** that might allow pest entry

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Reporting ✓
- **Morning inspection:** "I found mouse droppings near the raw material storage - I've photographed them and called Quality immediately"
- **During production:** "There are several dead flies on the windowsill in Section 3 - I've stopped handling materials near that area and reported it"
- **Equipment check:** "I can see gnaw marks on the cable to Machine 7 - I've switched it off and called maintenance"
- **External area:** "There are fresh bird droppings on pallets in the loading bay - I've moved clean pallets away and reported it"

### Poor Response ✗
- **Ignoring signs:** "I see some droppings but they might be old - I'll mention it later"
- **Cleaning up first:** "I swept up the dead insects before taking photos"
- **Assuming it's nothing:** "It's only one mouse dropping - probably not worth reporting"
- **Informal reporting:** "I told my colleague about the flies but didn't make an official report"

## What Happens After You Report

### Immediate Response
- **Investigation** by Quality team or pest control coordinator
- **Risk assessment** of affected products and areas
- **Enhanced monitoring** with additional traps or inspections
- **Cleaning and sanitisation** of affected areas

### Follow-up Actions
- **Professional pest control** treatment if needed
- **Building maintenance** to seal entry points
- **Procedure review** to prevent recurrence
- **Additional training** if knowledge gaps identified

### Documentation
- **NCA completion** with full investigation details
- **Corrective actions** recorded and tracked
- **Monitoring results** from enhanced surveillance
- **Trend analysis** to identify patterns or problem areas

## Prevention - How You Can Help
