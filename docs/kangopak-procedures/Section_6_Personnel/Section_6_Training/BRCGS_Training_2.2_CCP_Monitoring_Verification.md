**Kangopak Procedure:** BRC Hazard and Risk Management Procedure

# Critical Control Point (CCP) Monitoring & Verification Training

**Module:** CCP Monitoring & Verification  
**Audience:** Personnel responsible for CCP monitoring  
**BRCGS Reference:** 2.8.1, 6.1.3  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 2.2 BRC Hazard and Risk Management Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** what Critical Control Points (CCPs) are and why they're essential for product safety
2. **Execute** proper monitoring procedures for CCPs according to documented requirements
3. **Take appropriate corrective action** when CCP limits are exceeded or monitoring shows problems

## What Are Critical Control Points (CCPs)?

Critical Control Points are steps in our production process where we can prevent, eliminate, or reduce product safety hazards to acceptable levels. They are the most important control measures - if they fail, our packaging could be unsafe for product contact.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**
- 2.8.1: Monitoring system established for each CCP
- 6.1.3: Specific training for personnel on manufacturing process control points

**Kangopak Requirement:** Personnel responsible for monitoring/verification on the CCP Chart are specifically trained to ensure they have necessary skills/knowledge to conduct duties to the required standard.

## Understanding the CCP System

### What Makes a Control Point "Critical"
**Three key criteria:**
1. **Hazard control:** This step controls a significant product safety hazard
2. **Last chance:** No later step will eliminate or reduce the hazard
3. **Loss of control:** If this step fails, unsafe product could reach consumers

### Types of CCPs in Packaging
**Temperature control:** Heat sealing, sterilisation processes
**Chemical control:** Ink adhesion, migration testing, cleaning validation
**Physical control:** Metal detection, seal integrity, contamination prevention
**Biological control:** Sanitisation effectiveness, microbiological barriers

### CCP vs Other Control Measures
**CCPs** - Critical for safety, must be monitored continuously, have established limits
**Operational Prerequisites** - Important for quality, support CCP effectiveness
**Good Manufacturing Practice** - Basic requirements, foundation for all other controls

## Your Role in CCP Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring Responsibilities
**Before starting your shift:**
- **Check monitoring equipment** is working correctly
- **Verify calibration** is current and accurate
- **Review previous shift records** for any issues or trends
- **Confirm your competency** - you must be trained and authorised for this role

**During monitoring:**
- **Follow procedures exactly** - no shortcuts or modifications
- **Record results promptly** and accurately
- **Compare to established limits** immediately
- **Take action** when limits are exceeded
- **Never guess or estimate** - if unsure, ask for help

**At end of shift:**
- **Complete all records** with signatures and times
- **Report any problems** to incoming shift or supervision
- **Secure monitoring equipment** and records
- **Hand over properly** to next trained person

### Understanding Critical Limits
**What are critical limits?**
Specific measurable criteria that must be met at each CCP. They separate safe from unsafe conditions.

**Examples:**
- **Temperature:** Minimum 180°C for heat sealing
- **Time:** Hold for exactly 15 seconds at specified temperature
- **Detection:** Metal detector must detect 2mm iron sphere
- **pH level:** Cleaning solution must be between 10.5-11.0

**Why they're critical:**
- Based on scientific evidence and regulations
- Proven to control the specific hazard
- Not meeting them means product may be unsafe
- Must be monitored continuously during production

## Monitoring Procedures

### Taking Measurements
**Accuracy is essential:**
- **Use calibrated equipment** only - check calibration status
- **Follow standard methods** exactly as documented
- **Take measurements at correct frequency** (every batch, hourly, etc.)
- **Record immediately** - don't rely on memory
- **Include units of measurement** (°C, seconds, mm, etc.)

### Recording Results
**What must be recorded:**
- **Measured value** with correct units
- **Time and date** of measurement
- **Your name/initials** as the person who took the measurement
- **Batch or lot identification** being monitored
- **Any observations** about unusual conditions

**Record keeping rules:**
- **Write clearly** in permanent ink
- **No correction fluid** - cross out errors and initial
- **Complete records immediately** - no gaps or delays
- **Store records securely** for required retention period

### Recognising Problems
**When limits are exceeded:**
- **Values outside** established critical limits
- **Equipment malfunction** affecting measurement accuracy
- **Unusual conditions** that might affect CCP effectiveness
- **Missing data** or gaps in monitoring records

**When monitoring shows trends:**
- **Results approaching** critical limits
- **Equipment readings** becoming inconsistent
- **Process variations** that could affect control
- **External factors** (power failures, temperature fluctuations)

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate Actions When Limits Exceeded
**STOP production immediately:**
- Don't produce any more product until problem is resolved
- Secure all product made since last acceptable measurement
- Notify supervisor or Quality team immediately
- Document exactly what happened and when

### Product Assessment
**Segregate affected product:**
- Identify all product that might be affected
- Use traceability records to determine scope
- Quarantine product until safety assessment complete
- Label clearly as "HOLD - CCP Investigation"

**Safety evaluation:**
- Technical assessment of actual risk to consumers
- Review of similar situations and outcomes
- Customer notification if required
- Decision on product disposition (release, rework, or dispose)

### System Restoration
**Fix the problem:**
- Identify root cause of limit exceedance
- Repair or adjust equipment as needed
- Verify critical limits can be achieved consistently
- Re-calibrate monitoring equipment if necessary

**Resume production:**
- Confirm system is back under control
- Take additional measurements to verify
- Document corrective actions taken
- Return to normal monitoring frequency

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good CCP Monitoring ✓
- **Heat sealing:** "Temperature dropped to 175°C at 14:30 - stopped production immediately, adjusted heater, confirmed 180°C before restart at 14:45"
- **Metal detection:** "Detector failed to pick up 2mm test piece at 10:15 - stopped line, called maintenance, re-tested and passed at 11:00"
- **pH monitoring:** "Cleaning solution pH was 9.8 at start of cleaning cycle - adjusted chemical dosing, re-tested at 10.6 before continuing"

### Poor Monitoring ✗
- **Incomplete records:** Leaving time gaps in monitoring charts
- **Ignoring trends:** "Temperature has been dropping all morning but it's still within limits"
- **Unauthorised adjustments:** Changing equipment settings without proper training
- **Delayed action:** "I noticed the problem an hour ago but finished the batch first"

## Verification Activities

### What Is Verification?
Verification confirms that our CCP monitoring is working correctly and the hazards are actually being controlled.

**Daily verification:**
- **Calibration checks** of monitoring equipment
- **Review of records** for completeness and accuracy
- **Trend analysis** to spot developing problems
- **Corrective action follow-up** to ensure effectiveness

**Periodic verification:**
- **Independent testing** to confirm hazard control
- **Procedure review** to ensure still appropriate
- **Training effectiveness** assessment
- **Customer or regulatory feedback** on performance

### Your Role in Verification
**Supporting verification activities:**
- **Maintain accurate records** that can be reviewed
- **Report equipment issues** that affect monitoring accuracy
- **Participate in training** to maintain competency
- **Provide feedback** on procedure effectiveness
- **Support audits** by explaining your monitoring activities

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What are the three actions you must take immediately when a CCP critical limit is exceeded?**
   - Answer: Stop production, secure affected product, notify supervisor/Quality team immediately

2. **Why must CCP monitoring be done by trained and competent personnel only?**
   - Answer: CCPs are critical for product safety - errors could result in unsafe product reaching consumers; proper monitoring requires specific knowledge and skills

3. **What information must be recorded each time you monitor a CCP?**
   - Answer: Measured value with units, time/date, your name/initials, batch/lot ID, any unusual observations

## Simple Practical Activity (15 minutes)

**CCP Monitoring Simulation:**

1. **Equipment setup:** Use temperature monitoring equipment or similar device
2. **Take measurements:** Practice proper measurement technique
3. **Record keeping:** Complete monitoring chart correctly
4. **Problem scenario:** Trainer introduces "out-of-limit" reading
