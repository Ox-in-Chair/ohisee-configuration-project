**Key Question:** Can you still protect our packaging products from foreign body contamination in your daily work?

## REFRESHER LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this refresher, you will have **demonstrated** that you can still:

1. **Identify** foreign body contamination risks specific to your work area
2. **Operate** detection and prevention systems correctly without guidance
3. **Respond** immediately and appropriately to contamination incidents
4. **Complete** register inspections and documentation accurately

## PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT SCENARIOS

### **SCENARIO 1: Hidden Metal Detection**
**Situation:** During routine metal detection, the alarm sounds but you can't immediately see any metal objects. What is your systematic approach?

**Correct Response Process:**
1. Do not ignore or reset alarm - investigate thoroughly
2. Remove all items systematically (pockets, tools, clothing)
3. Re-test each item individually through detector
4. Check for hidden metal (staples in notebooks, reinforced clothing)
5. Only proceed when source is identified and removed
6. Document any contamination source found

### **SCENARIO 2: Glass Breakage Above Production**
**Situation:** A glass light cover breaks directly above an active packaging line. Describe your immediate 6-step emergency response.

**Correct Response Sequence:**
1. **STOP** - Immediately halt all production on affected line
2. **ISOLATE** - Clear all personnel from contamination zone
3. **REPORT** - Notify supervisor/management immediately
4. **SECURE** - Quarantine all potentially affected product
5. **CLEAN** - Only begin cleanup after supervisor authorization
6. **DOCUMENT** - Complete full incident report with details

### **SCENARIO 3: Register Discrepancy**
**Situation:** During your register inspection, you discover a listed glass item is missing from its registered location. What actions do you take?

**Correct Response Process:**
1. **Immediate notification** to supervisor - do not delay
2. **Production halt** if item could have contaminated product
3. **Systematic search** of immediate area for broken pieces
4. **Product investigation** - check for contamination evidence
5. **Documentation** - update register with "MISSING" status
6. **Investigation cooperation** - assist in determining cause

## FACILITATOR NOTES

### **Pre-Session Setup (20 minutes)**
- [ ] Prepare all test materials and hide metal detection items
- [ ] Set up emergency response simulation area
- [ ] Verify register inspection equipment functional
- [ ] Review any recent contamination incidents for discussion

### **Critical Facilitation Points**

**Opening Emphasis:**
"Every person in this room has the power to cause or prevent a R500,000+ product recall through their daily actions. Today we verify you still have that protective power."

**During Material Classification:**
"Remember - if you're not certain, treat it as hazardous. Better to be over-cautious than to cause contamination."

**Emergency Response Practice:**
"In a real emergency, your immediate response in the first 30 seconds determines whether we contain the incident or face a major recall."

**Cost Reality Check:**
"A single contamination incident can cost more than most people's annual salary. Your competency directly protects the company's financial stability and everyone's job security."

### **Common Refresher Challenges**

**Challenge:** "Nothing has changed since last year"
**Response:** "Standards don't change, but equipment wears, habits drift, and new hazards appear. Let's verify your detection skills are still sharp."

**Challenge:** Overconfidence in detection abilities
**Response:** "Professional pilots still do pre-flight checks every flight. Professionals in high-risk industries always verify their competency."

**Challenge:** Rushing through register inspections
**Response:** "Each inspection item represents potential R50,000+ recall risk. Take the time needed to be thorough."
