- **Report system problems** immediately
- **Don't print copies** unless specifically authorised
- **Log off properly** to protect access

## Following Work Instructions

### Reading and Understanding
**Before starting work:**
- **Read the entire instruction** - don't just skim through
- **Check you understand** each step before beginning
- **Identify required materials** and equipment
- **Note any special precautions** or safety requirements
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear

### Step-by-Step Compliance
**During work:**
- **Follow each step** in the exact order specified
- **Use specified materials** and equipment only
- **Don't skip steps** even if you think they're unnecessary
- **Don't take shortcuts** even if they seem faster
- **Complete all checks** as documented

### When Instructions Don't Work
**If you encounter problems:**
- **Stop work** immediately if safety could be affected
- **Report the problem** to your supervisor or team leader
- **Don't improvise** solutions without approval
- **Document what went wrong** for investigation
- **Wait for guidance** before continuing

## Quality and Safety Checks

### Built-in Quality Checks
Most work instructions include:
- **Pre-work checks:** Equipment, materials, environmental conditions
- **In-process checks:** Measurements, visual inspections, functional tests
- **Post-work checks:** Final inspections, cleaning, documentation
- **Handover checks:** What to communicate to next person

### Your Responsibility for Checks
**Why checks are important:**
- **Prevent problems** reaching customers
- **Catch issues early** when they're easier to fix
- **Maintain consistency** across all shifts and operators
- **Provide evidence** that procedures were followed

**How to do checks properly:**
- **Use specified methods** and equipment
- **Record results** accurately and immediately
- **Compare to acceptance criteria** in the instruction
- **Take action** when results are outside limits
- **Sign off** to confirm checks were completed

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Adherence to Instructions ✓
- **Pre-work preparation:** "I read the full work instruction for this new product before starting and checked I had all required materials"
- **Step-by-step compliance:** "I followed each step exactly as written, including the 5-minute settling time that seemed unnecessary"
- **Quality checking:** "I completed all dimensional checks as specified and recorded results on the job card"
- **Problem reporting:** "The instruction said to heat seal at 180°C but our equipment only reaches 175°C - I reported this before starting production"

### Poor Adherence ✗
- **Skipping steps:** "I didn't think the cleaning step was necessary since the equipment looked clean"
- **Using experience instead:** "I've done this job for years - I don't need to read the instruction"
- **Taking shortcuts:** "I combined steps 3 and 4 to save time"
- **Improvising solutions:** "The specified tool was broken so I used a different one that seemed similar"

### Communication About Instructions
- **Seeking clarification:** "Step 7 isn't clear to me - can you show me the correct technique?"
- **Reporting improvements:** "I think step 12 could be clearer - here's how I would explain it"
- **Updating knowledge:** "I see this instruction was updated last week - can you explain what changed?"

## Changes and Updates
