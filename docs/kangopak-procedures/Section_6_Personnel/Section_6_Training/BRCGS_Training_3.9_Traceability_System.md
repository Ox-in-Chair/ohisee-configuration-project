**Audience:** System users and production personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 3.10.1, 3.10.5, 3.10.6  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 3.9 BRCGS Traceability Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** why traceability is critical for product packaging safety and regulatory compliance
2. **Operate** the traceability system correctly to maintain accurate product history records
3. **Participate** in traceability testing exercises to verify system effectiveness

## Why Traceability Matters

Traceability allows us to quickly identify where products have gone and what materials were used to make them. If there's ever a safety problem, traceability helps us find affected products quickly to protect consumers and minimise business impact.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**
- 3.10.1: Systems to ensure traceability of all raw materials and products
- 3.10.5: System tested at least annually
- 3.10.6: Testing completed within specified timeframes

**Kangopak Requirement:** Traceability system rigorously tested annually to verify it can trace products forward and backward through the supply chain within required timeframes.

## Understanding Traceability

### What Is Traceability?
Traceability is the ability to follow products and materials:
- **Backward:** What raw materials went into a specific product?
- **Forward:** Where did products made from specific materials go?
- **Across time:** When were materials received, processed, and shipped?
- **Through processes:** Which equipment and procedures were used?

### Why Traceability Is Essential
**Product safety emergencies:**
- **Rapid identification** of affected products during incidents
- **Targeted recalls** instead of shutting down everything
- **Protection of consumers** by removing unsafe products quickly
- **Minimised business impact** by limiting scope of problems

**Regulatory compliance:**
- **Legal requirement** under product safety regulations
- **Authority cooperation** during investigations
- **Audit evidence** for BRCGS and customer requirements
- **Due diligence** demonstration for legal protection

**Customer confidence:**
- **Rapid response** to customer concerns
- **Professional handling** of quality issues
- **Evidence of control** over supply chain
- **Support for customer traceability** requirements

## Key Elements of Our Traceability System

### Raw Material Identification
**What must be recorded:**
- **Supplier name** and location
- **Material specification** and grade
- **Lot or batch numbers** from supplier
- **Delivery date** and quantities received
- **Kangopak internal** lot identification

### Production Records
**Critical information captured:**
- **Job or batch numbers** for each production run
- **Raw materials used** with lot numbers
- **Production date** and shift information
- **Equipment used** and operators involved
- **Quality checks** performed and results

### Finished Product Tracking
**Essential details:**
- **Customer identification** and delivery address
- **Product specifications** and quantities
- **Production batch numbers** used
- **Shipping date** and transport details
- **Invoice or order numbers** for commercial traceability

### Document Links
**How information connects:**
- **Material certificates** linked to production records
- **Job cards** showing material consumption
- **Delivery notes** connecting products to customers
- **Quality records** tied to specific batches
- **Customer feedback** traceable to production dates

## Your Role in Traceability

### Daily Operations
**Information you must provide:**
- **Accurate recording** of all batch and lot numbers
- **Complete documentation** of materials used in production
- **Proper labelling** of finished products with traceability codes
- **Timely completion** of production records
- **Clear handwriting** or data entry for readability

### Record Keeping Requirements
**What must be documented:**
- **Material lot numbers** from containers used
- **Quantities consumed** during production
- **Production batch codes** assigned to finished products
- **Date and time** of production activities
- **Your identification** as operator or recorder

**Documentation standards:**
- **Immediate recording** - don't rely on memory
- **Permanent ink** for handwritten records
- **No gaps or omissions** in data
- **Clear corrections** if errors are made (cross out and initial)
- **Secure storage** of completed records

### System Interface
**Electronic systems:**
- **Accurate data entry** of all required information
- **Verification** of information before saving
- **Backup procedures** when systems are unavailable
- **Security** - log off properly and protect access
- **Problem reporting** when systems malfunction

## Traceability Testing

### Annual Testing Requirement
**Purpose of testing:**
- **Verify system effectiveness** in real situations
- **Identify gaps** or weaknesses in procedures
- **Train personnel** in emergency procedures
- **Demonstrate compliance** to customers and auditors
- **Continuous improvement** of traceability processes

### Testing Process
**Typical test scenario:**
1. **Select a finished product** delivered to customers
2. **Trace backward** to identify all raw materials used
3. **Trace forward** to identify all customers who received products from same materials
4. **Time the process** to ensure meets requirements (typically 4 hours)
5. **Document results** and identify any problems
6. **Implement improvements** based on findings

### Your Role in Testing
**When testing occurs:**
- **Provide information** requested by test coordinators
- **Locate records** quickly and accurately
- **Explain processes** used during production
- **Support investigation** by answering questions
- **Learn from results** to improve daily practices

## Practical Examples

### Traceability in Action
**Scenario:** Customer complaint about packaging defect
**Traceability process:**
1. **Identify batch code** on customer's packaging
2. **Find production records** for that batch
3. **Check raw materials** used in production
4. **Review quality checks** performed during production
5. **Identify other customers** who received products from same materials
6. **Assess need** for broader investigation or customer notification

### Daily Traceability Tasks
**Material receipt:** "I recorded the supplier lot number 240315A from the film roll label onto the goods received record"
**Production:** "I documented that we used material lots 240315A and 240318B to make batch KP240901 during morning shift"
**Quality control:** "I linked the test results for seal strength to batch KP240901 on the quality record"
**Shipping:** "I confirmed that batch KP240901 was shipped to Customer ABC on delivery note DN123456"

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Documentation Gaps
**Problem:** Missing or incomplete lot number records
**Impact:** Cannot trace materials or products effectively
**Solution:** Check records before finishing each task, report gaps immediately

**Problem:** Illegible handwriting on production records
**Impact:** Cannot read critical traceability information
**Solution:** Write clearly, use printed letters for important codes

### System Failures
**Problem:** Computer system unavailable during production
**Impact:** Electronic records not captured in real time
**Solution:** Use backup paper records, enter data when system restored

**Problem:** Incorrect data entry in electronic systems
**Impact:** Traceability information leads to wrong conclusions
**Solution:** Verify all entries, report errors immediately for correction

### Process Issues
**Problem:** Multiple material lots mixed without documentation
**Impact:** Cannot determine which materials affected specific products
**Solution:** Keep lots separate, document any combinations clearly

## Emergency Response

### When Traceability Is Needed Urgently
**Potential situations:**
- **Customer complaint** about product safety
- **Supplier notification** of material problem
- **Internal quality** issue discovered
- **Regulatory inquiry** about specific products
- **Media attention** requiring rapid response

### Supporting Emergency Response
**Your responsibilities:**
- **Respond quickly** to requests for information
- **Provide accurate data** even under pressure
- **Locate records** efficiently using filing systems
- **Explain clearly** what you know about the situation
- **Continue normal operations** unless specifically told otherwise

**What you might be asked:**
- **When** specific materials were used
- **Which equipment** was used for production
- **What quality checks** were performed
- **Who else** was involved in production
- **Any unusual events** that occurred
