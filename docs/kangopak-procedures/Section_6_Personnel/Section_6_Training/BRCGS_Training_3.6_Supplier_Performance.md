## Why Supplier Performance Monitoring Matters

Every raw material that comes into our factory affects the safety and quality of our packaging products. Poor supplier performance can lead to contaminated materials, product recalls, customer complaints, and loss of certification. Effective supplier monitoring protects our customers and our reputation.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**
- 3.6.1: Supplier approval procedure based on risk analysis
- 3.6.3: Ongoing supplier performance review with defined criteria
- 3.6.5: Up-to-date approved supplier list

**Kangopak Standard:** All suppliers of raw materials must be approved before use and monitored continuously for performance against defined criteria.

## Initial Supplier Approval (BRCGS 3.6.1-3.6.2)

### Risk-Based Approval Process
Before any new supplier can provide materials to Kangopak, they must pass our approval process:

**High-risk materials** (direct food contact):
- **BRCGS certification** or equivalent GFSI-benchmarked standard
- **Full supplier audit** by competent auditor
- **Detailed documentation** of Product Safety systems and traceability

**Medium-risk materials** (potential food contact):
- **Quality management certification** (ISO 9001 or equivalent)
- **Supplier questionnaire** covering product safety systems
- **Certificate of compliance** for products supplied

**Lower-risk materials** (no food contact):
- **Basic supplier information** and capability assessment
- **Quality declarations** and specification agreements
- **Regulatory compliance** confirmation

### Documentation Required
All supplier approvals must include:
- **Risk assessment** justifying approval method
- **Competency evidence** of person approving supplier
- **Traceability verification** from supplier systems
- **Product specifications** and compliance statements

## Ongoing Performance Monitoring (BRCGS 3.6.3-3.6.4)

### Performance Criteria
We monitor all suppliers against defined criteria:

**Delivery Performance:**
- **On-time delivery** - target 95% within agreed delivery window
- **Correct quantities** - no significant over/under deliveries
- **Proper documentation** - certificates, specifications updated

**Quality Performance:**
- **Specification compliance** - all materials meet agreed specifications
- **Defect rates** - target <2% defective materials received
- **Corrective actions** - prompt response to quality issues

**Communication Performance:**
- **Change notifications** - advance notice of any material or process changes
- **Certification status** - maintain valid certifications
- **Emergency response** - availability during supply issues

### Monitoring Methods
**Monthly performance reviews:**
- **Delivery statistics** - analyse delivery performance data
- **Quality metrics** - review incoming inspection results
- **Issue tracking** - monitor complaints and corrective actions

**Annual assessments:**
- **Certification review** - verify current certification status
- **Questionnaire updates** - refresh supplier information
- **Risk reassessment** - review risk category and approval method

**Immediate triggers:**
- **Certification changes** - loss or suspension of certificates
- **Quality failures** - significant product defects or contamination
- **Communication failures** - unreported changes or poor responsiveness

## Approved Supplier List Management (BRCGS 3.6.5-3.6.6)

### Maintaining the Approved List
**Database requirements:**
- **Current approvals only** - expired or suspended suppliers removed
- **Easy access** for relevant personnel
- **Regular updates** - changes recorded immediately
- **Backup systems** - secure storage with recovery options

**Information tracked:**
- **Supplier contact details** and key personnel
- **Approval status** and expiry dates
- **Risk category** and approval method used
- **Performance history** and current issues
- **Certification details** and renewal dates

### Traceability Requirements (BRCGS 3.6.6)
When purchasing through agents or brokers:
- **Know the manufacturer** - identity of actual material producer
- **Obtain approval information** - same standards apply to manufacturer
- **Verify broker certification** - if broker is BRCGS certified
- **Document the chain** - complete traceability from manufacturer to Kangopak

## Emergency Procurement (BRCGS 3.6.7)

### When Normal Suppliers Are Unavailable
Sometimes urgent supply needs require using non-approved suppliers:

**Approval requirements:**
- **Emergency approval** by quality manager
- **Risk assessment** of temporary supplier
- **Enhanced incoming inspection** - additional testing/verification
- **Limited use period** - time-bound approval with review date

**Documentation needed:**
- **Certificates of analysis** for all materials received
- **Compliance statements** covering Product Safety requirements
- **Temporary approval record** with justification and limits

**Follow-up actions:**
- **Normal approval process** if supplier needed long-term
- **Performance review** after emergency period
- **System improvement** to prevent future emergency situations

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Supplier Management ✓
- **Proactive monitoring:** "Our monthly supplier review identified a drop in delivery performance before it became critical"
- **Change management:** "Supplier notified us 30 days before changing their raw material source, allowing proper evaluation"
- **Documentation:** "All our approved suppliers have current certificates and compliance statements on file"
- **Emergency response:** "When our main supplier had production issues, our pre-qualified backup supplier maintained continuity"

### Poor Practices to Avoid ✗
- **Reactive approach:** "We only review suppliers when problems occur"
- **Outdated approvals:** "Some suppliers on our list haven't been reviewed for two years"
- **Missing traceability:** "We buy from brokers but don't know who actually makes our materials"
- **Emergency shortcuts:** "We used an unapproved supplier without any checks because we were desperate"

## Risk-Based Decision Making

### High-Risk Scenarios Requiring Extra Attention:
- **New suppliers** providing food-contact materials
- **Suppliers in developing countries** with limited regulatory oversight
- **Single-source suppliers** where alternatives are limited
- **Recent quality issues** at supplier facilities
- **Economic pressures** that might compromise supplier systems

### Medium-Risk Situations:
- **Established suppliers** with good track records
- **Multi-sourced materials** with approved alternatives
- **Suppliers with current certifications** and regular audits
- **Materials with limited Product Safety impact**

## Supplier Relationship Management

### Building Strong Partnerships:
- **Clear communication** of our requirements and expectations
- **Regular feedback** on performance (both positive and areas for improvement)
- **Joint improvement projects** to enhance capability
- **Long-term contracts** to reward good performance
- **Knowledge sharing** on market trends and regulatory changes

### Managing Poor Performance:
1. **Immediate response** - secure affected materials, assess impact
2. **Investigation** - understand root causes with supplier
3. **Corrective actions** - agreed improvement plan with timelines
4. **Monitoring** - enhanced review frequency until performance improves
5. **Escalation** - suspension or removal if improvements not sustained

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What are the three key methods for initial approval of high-risk suppliers?**
   - Answer: BRCGS/GFSI certification, supplier audit by competent auditor, or quality management certification with compliance statements

2. **How often should supplier performance be formally reviewed, and what triggers immediate reviews?**
   - Answer: Monthly performance reviews and annual assessments; triggers include certification changes, quality failures, or communication failures

3. **What additional requirements apply when purchasing through brokers or agents?**
   - Answer: Must know identity of actual manufacturer, obtain same approval information for manufacturer, verify broker certification if applicable

## Simple Practical Activity (10 minutes)

**Supplier Performance Review Exercise:**

1. **Case study review:** Present a supplier with mixed performance data (good delivery, poor quality)
2. **Group assessment:** Work in pairs to evaluate the supplier's overall performance
3. **Action planning:** Identify what actions would be appropriate (continue, improve, suspend)
4. **Documentation practice:** Complete a sample supplier performance review form
5. **Discussion:** Share decisions and reasoning with the group

**Materials provided:**
- Sample supplier performance data
- Blank performance review forms
- Criteria checklists
