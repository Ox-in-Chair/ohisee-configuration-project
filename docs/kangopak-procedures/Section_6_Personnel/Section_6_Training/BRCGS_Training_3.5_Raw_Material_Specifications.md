**Audience:** Material handlers and production personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 3.4.1, 1.3.2  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 3.5 BRCGS Process Control Procedure

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** why raw material specifications are critical for food packaging safety and quality

## Why Raw Material Specifications Matter

Raw material specifications ensure that every component used in our packaging meets customer requirements and Product Safety standards. Using wrong materials could make packaging unsafe for food contact or cause it to fail during use.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (3.4.1):** Specifications shall be available for all raw materials and products.

**Kangopak Requirement:** Understanding material specifications including thickness, appearance, description, width, artwork, variant, size of spout and cap, supplier name, size and opening force of zipper, with employee acknowledgment on job cards.

## Understanding Material Specifications

### What Are Material Specifications?
Specifications are detailed documents that describe:
- **Physical properties:** Thickness, width, length, weight
- **Appearance standards:** Colour, transparency, surface finish
- **Functional requirements:** Strength, barrier properties, sealability  
- **Safety criteria:** Food contact compliance, migration limits
- **Identification details:** Supplier, grade, lot coding requirements

### Types of Materials We Use
**Primary packaging films:**
- **Polyethylene (PE)** for barrier and sealing properties
- **Polypropylene (PP)** for clarity and strength
- **Polyamide (PA/Nylon)** for barrier and puncture resistance
- **Multi-layer laminates** combining different material properties

**Components and accessories:**
- **Spouts and caps** with specific dimensions and opening forces
- **Zippers** with defined opening and closing characteristics
- **Print inks and adhesives** for decoration and lamination
- **Barrier coatings** for specific food protection requirements

### Critical Specification Parameters

#### Physical Dimensions
**Thickness measurements:**
- Typically measured in microns (µm) or gauge
- Critical for barrier properties and strength
- Must be within tight tolerances for Product Safety
- Affects equipment settings and sealing parameters

**Width and length:**
- Must match customer packaging equipment
- Affects product appearance and functionality
- Critical for automated filling and sealing operations

#### Appearance Standards
**Colour requirements:**
- Specified using colour matching systems
- Important for brand recognition and consumer appeal
- Must be consistent across all production batches
- Affects product shelf appeal and customer satisfaction

**Print quality:**
- Registration accuracy for multiple colours
- Density requirements for text and graphics
- Clarity requirements for legal and nutritional information
- Bar code readability for retail scanning

#### Functional Properties
**Barrier properties:**
- Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) for product protection
- Water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) for moisture control
- Specific barrier requirements for different food types
- Critical for maintaining food quality and safety

**Mechanical properties:**
- Tensile strength for handling and transport
- Puncture resistance for product protection
- Seal strength for package integrity
- Opening characteristics for consumer convenience

## Specification Verification Process

### Before Starting Production
**Check job card specifications:**
- **Read all requirements** carefully before beginning work
- **Compare to incoming materials** to verify match
- **Check material certificates** and test data if provided
- **Verify quantities** match job requirements
- **Initial job card** to confirm you've reviewed specifications

### Material Inspection Procedures
**Visual inspection:**
- **Appearance check** - colour, clarity, surface defects
- **Dimensional verification** - width, length measurements where possible
- **Print quality assessment** - clarity, registration, colour accuracy
- **Damage inspection** - tears, creases, contamination

**Documentation review:**
- **Certificate of compliance** from supplier
- **Test results** for critical properties if available
- **Lot identification** and traceability information
- **Storage and handling** requirements

### Using Measuring Equipment
**Thickness measurement:**
- **Use calibrated gauges** only
- **Take measurements** at multiple points
- **Record results** accurately on job card
- **Compare to specification limits** immediately
- **Report deviations** before continuing production

**Other measurements:**
- **Width verification** using appropriate measuring tools
- **Weight checks** if specified on job card
- **Colour assessment** using approved methods
- **Functional testing** as required by specifications

## When Materials Don't Meet Specifications

### Recognising Non-Conformance
**Common specification failures:**
- **Dimensions outside tolerances** (thickness, width, length)
- **Appearance defects** (wrong colour, surface marks, print errors)
- **Physical damage** (tears, holes, contamination)
- **Missing documentation** (certificates, test results)
- **Wrong grade or type** (different material than specified)

### Immediate Actions Required
**When you find non-conforming materials:**
1. **STOP using the material** immediately
2. **Segregate non-conforming material** from conforming stock
3. **Report to supervisor** or Quality team immediately
4. **Document the problem** on job card or non-conformance report
5. **Wait for instructions** before continuing production

### Investigation and Resolution
**What happens next:**
- **Technical assessment** of the deviation impact
- **Customer notification** if required
- **Supplier notification** for investigation
- **Decision on material disposition** (use, return, or reject)
- **Corrective action** to prevent recurrence

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Specification Management ✓
- **Pre-production check:** "I compared the incoming film thickness specification (25±2 microns) with the job card requirement and they match"
- **Problem identification:** "The film colour looks darker than the approved standard - I've stopped production and called Quality"
- **Documentation:** "I measured thickness at 3 points and recorded all results on the job card before initialling"
- **Communication:** "The supplier certificate shows different barrier properties than our specification - I've reported this for investigation"

### Poor Specification Management ✗
- **Assuming compliance:** "The material looks about right - I'll start production without checking specifications"
- **Ignoring deviations:** "The thickness is slightly out of spec but it's probably close enough"
- **Continuing with problems:** "I noticed the colour was wrong but finished the batch anyway"
- **Incomplete documentation:** "I didn't bother measuring everything - just initialled the job card"

## Special Requirements

### Food Contact Materials
**Critical safety requirements:**
- **Migration testing** to ensure no harmful substances transfer to food
- **Heavy metals compliance** within legal limits
- **Overall migration limits** for total substance transfer
