**Kangopak Requirement:** Personnel competencies for work impacting product safety, quality, and legality with specific training and competency assessment.

## Understanding Process Control Points

### What Makes a Control Point Important?
**Process control points are steps where:**
- **Product specifications** are established or verified
- **Quality parameters** must be maintained within limits
- **Safety requirements** are implemented or checked
- **Customer requirements** are met or exceeded
- **Process efficiency** is optimised

### Types of Process Control Points
**Temperature control:** Heat sealing, cooling, drying processes
**Pressure control:** Forming, sealing, testing pressures
**Time control:** Processing duration, cooling times, curing periods
**Dimensional control:** Thickness, width, length specifications
**Appearance control:** Print quality, colour consistency, surface finish
**Functional control:** Seal strength, barrier properties, opening force

### Control Points vs Critical Control Points (CCPs)
**Process control points:** Important for quality and customer satisfaction
**Critical Control Points (CCPs):** Essential for Product Safety - failure could make products unsafe
**Both require:** Specific training, documented procedures, regular monitoring
**Key difference:** CCPs have more stringent monitoring and corrective action requirements

## Your Role in Process Control

### Pre-Production Setup
**Before starting production:**
- **Review job specifications** and process control requirements
- **Check equipment settings** against documented parameters
- **Verify measuring instruments** are calibrated and working
- **Confirm material specifications** match job requirements
- **Complete pre-production checks** according to procedures

### During Production Monitoring
**Continuous monitoring:**
- **Check parameters regularly** according to specified frequency
- **Record measurements accurately** on control charts
- **Compare results** to specification limits immediately
- **Look for trends** that might indicate developing problems
- **Maintain awareness** of process conditions throughout shift

**Key monitoring points:**
- **Machine settings:** Temperature, pressure, speed, timing
- **Product dimensions:** Thickness, width, length measurements  
- **Appearance standards:** Print quality, colour, surface defects
- **Functional properties:** Seal strength, opening characteristics
- **Environmental conditions:** Temperature, humidity, cleanliness

### Record Keeping Requirements
**What must be documented:**
- **All measurements** with date, time, and operator initials
- **Equipment settings** at start of production and when changed
- **Batch information** including raw material lot numbers
- **Any deviations** from normal parameters
- **Corrective actions** taken when problems occur

**Documentation standards:**
- **Write clearly** in permanent ink - no pencil
- **Complete immediately** - don't leave gaps to fill later
- **Sign and date** all entries
- **No correction fluid** - cross out errors and initial
- **Store securely** for required retention period

## Understanding Specifications and Limits

### Types of Specifications
**Customer specifications:** Requirements from customers for their products
**Internal specifications:** Kangopak standards for process control
**Regulatory requirements:** Legal standards for food contact materials
**Industry standards:** Best practice guidelines for packaging materials

### Control Limits
**Target value:** The ideal measurement we aim to achieve
**Tolerance range:** Acceptable variation around the target
**Warning limits:** Values that indicate process may be going out of control
**Action limits:** Values that require immediate corrective action

**Example:**
- Target: 25 microns thickness
- Tolerance: ±2 microns (23-27 microns acceptable)
- Warning limits: 23.5-26.5 microns (investigate trend)
- Action limits: <23 or >27 microns (stop and correct)

## Recognising and Responding to Problems

### Process Variations
**Normal variation:** Small fluctuations within specification limits
**Trend:** Gradual movement towards specification limits
**Shift:** Sudden change in average process performance
**Out of control:** Measurements outside acceptable limits

### When to Take Action
**Immediate action required:**
- **Measurements outside** action limits
- **Equipment malfunction** affecting process control
- **Material defects** that could affect final product
- **Safety hazards** that could cause harm

**Investigation needed:**
- **Trends approaching** warning or action limits
- **Unusual patterns** in measurement data
- **Customer complaints** about product quality
- **Equipment behaviour** different from normal

### Corrective Action Steps
**Step 1: Stop production**
- Don't make more potentially defective product
- Secure product made since last acceptable measurement
- Identify extent of potential problem

**Step 2: Investigate cause**
- Check equipment settings and calibration
- Review material specifications and quality
- Look for environmental factors (temperature, humidity)
- Consider operator technique or training needs

**Step 3: Correct the problem**
- Adjust equipment settings if needed
- Replace defective materials
- Recalibrate measuring instruments
- Provide additional training if necessary

**Step 4: Verify correction**
- Take additional measurements to confirm problem solved
- Resume production only when process is stable
- Monitor more closely initially to ensure stability
- Document all actions taken

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Process Control ✓
- **Temperature monitoring:** "Heat seal temperature was 182°C at 10:30 - within specification of 180-185°C, recorded on chart"
- **Dimensional control:** "Film thickness measurements show upward trend from 24.8 to 25.6 microns over 2 hours - investigating cause"  
- **Problem response:** "Seal strength dropped to 15N at 14:45 (specification 20-30N) - stopped production, found loose pressure setting, corrected and verified"
- **Documentation:** "All measurements recorded immediately with time stamps and my initials"

### Poor Process Control ✗
- **Ignoring trends:** "Thickness has been increasing all morning but it's still within limits - probably fine"
- **Incomplete records:** "I'll catch up on the paperwork at the end of the shift"
- **Wrong priorities:** "I know it's out of spec but we need to finish this order first"
- **Assumption making:** "The customer probably won't notice this small deviation"

## Quality Impact of Process Control
