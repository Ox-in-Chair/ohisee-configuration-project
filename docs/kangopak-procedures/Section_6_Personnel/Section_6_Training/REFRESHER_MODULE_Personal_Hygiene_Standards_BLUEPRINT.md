### Presenter Notes & Timing Cues

#### Opening Section (8 minutes)
**Common Issues to Address:**
- Staff may feel defensive about "checking" their competency
- **Response:** "This isn't about what you're doing wrong - it's about confirming you're still doing it right"
- Some may rush through hand washing demonstration

**Timing Cue:** "We have 8 minutes for context - let's move to hands-on verification"

#### Core Verification Section (25 minutes)
**Hand Hygiene Issues to Watch For:**
- Missing areas (thumbs, wrists, between fingers)
- Insufficient time (less than 20 seconds)
- Poor technique (not using soap properly)
- **Correction:** Show correct technique immediately, re-test

**Hair Coverage Issues to Watch For:**  
- Hair strands visible at edges of hat/net
- Loose hair accessories under covering
- Beard nets not covering completely
- **Correction:** Adjust covering, provide additional nets if needed

**Personal Items Issues to Watch For:**
- Watches, bracelets, earrings
- Multiple rings beyond plain wedding band
- Personal items in pockets
- **Correction:** Direct to lockers immediately

**Timing Cue:** "25 minutes for competency checks - move quickly through any clearly competent staff"

#### Assessment Section (10 minutes)
**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- **PASS:** All 5 competency areas demonstrated correctly
- **FAIL:** Any competency area not met - immediate remediation required
- **Borderline:** Give benefit of doubt if close - note for monitoring

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Each person must have signed competency form
- Failed competencies must trigger follow-up training
- Forms filed in personnel records within 24 hours

### Q&A Response Bank

**Q: "Why do we need refresher training if nothing has changed?"**
**A:** "Habits naturally drift over time. Research shows people gradually relax standards without realising it. This verification ensures you maintain the high standards that protect our products and customers."

**Q: "What if I fail the assessment?"**
**A:** "Failure means immediate retraining and re-assessment before you can work in product contact areas. It's not punitive - it's about ensuring product safety."

**Q: "My hair net keeps slipping - what should I do?"**
**A:** "Report it immediately. We'll get you a different size or style that stays secure. Never work with loose hair covering."

**Q: "Can I use hand sanitiser instead of soap and water?"**
**A:** "Sanitiser is additional protection at entry points. Proper soap and water washing is still required at all the standard times - break times, toilet visits, start of work."

**Q: "What about my prescription glasses?"**
**A:** "Prescription glasses are allowed and should be on the spectacles register. If they get damaged, report immediately - damaged glasses are a foreign body risk."
