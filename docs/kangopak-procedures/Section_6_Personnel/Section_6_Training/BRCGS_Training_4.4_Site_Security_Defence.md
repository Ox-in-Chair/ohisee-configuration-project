**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Security

# Site Security & Product Defence Awareness Training

**Module:** Site Security & Product Defence Awareness  
**Audience:** All employees (mandatory during induction)  
**BRCGS Reference:** 6.1.1, 4.4.1  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 4.4 BRCGS Security

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Recognise** potential security threats to our site and products that could affect Product Safety
2. **Implement** daily security practices to protect against deliberate contamination or tampering
3. **Report** suspicious activities or security concerns through appropriate channels

## Why Site Security Matters

Site security protects our packaging products from deliberate contamination, tampering, or sabotage that could harm consumers. Unlike accidental contamination, security threats are intentional acts that could cause serious harm to people and damage to Kangopak's reputation.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (4.4.1):** Sites must have documented procedures for site security and product defence.

**Kangopak Requirement:** All employees receive mandatory training during induction on site security policy, procedures, personal responsibility, reporting obligations, and expected conduct.

## Understanding Security Threats

### Types of Security Threats
**External threats:**
- **Unauthorised access** by people trying to enter the site
- **Deliberate contamination** of raw materials or finished products
- **Sabotage** of equipment or processes
- **Theft** of products, information, or equipment
- **Vandalism** of buildings or systems

**Internal threats:**
- **Disgruntled employees** who might tamper with products
- **Unauthorised visitors** in production areas
- **Information theft** of customer or process details
- **Accidental security breaches** due to poor procedures

### Why Packaging Companies Are Targets
**High visibility:** Food packaging problems get significant media attention
**Consumer impact:** Contaminated packaging affects many people quickly
**Supply chain disruption:** Problems can shut down customer operations
**Economic damage:** Recalls and investigations are very expensive
**Regulatory scrutiny:** Product Safety incidents attract government attention

## Daily Security Practices

### Access Control
**Your responsibilities:**
- **Use your own access card only** - never lend it to others
- **Report lost cards immediately** to security or management
- **Don't allow "tailgating"** - ensure each person uses their own card
- **Challenge unknown visitors** politely but firmly
- **Escort visitors** according to company policy
- **Lock doors** behind you in restricted areas

### Personal Identification
**ID badge requirements:**
- **Wear your badge** visibly at all times while on site
- **Include photo ID** so others can verify your identity
- **Report missing badges** immediately
- **Don't wear damaged badges** that can't be read clearly
- **Check visitor badges** are valid and up-to-date

### Area Security
**Production areas:**
- **Keep unauthorised people out** of production areas
- **Secure materials** when not in use
- **Lock equipment** that could affect product safety
- **Report unusual activities** or people where they shouldn't be
- **Follow clean desk policy** - don't leave sensitive information visible

### Information Security
**Protecting sensitive information:**
- **Customer details** - specifications, delivery schedules, complaints

**Basic information security:**
- **Lock your computer** when away from desk

## Practical Factory Examples

### Good Security Practice ✓
- **Access control:** "I noticed someone trying to follow me through the security door without using their card - I asked to see their ID"
- **Visitor management:** "A visitor asked detailed questions about our quality procedures - I referred them to the Quality Manager"
- **Information security:** "I found a customer specification sheet in the break room - I returned it to the office immediately"
- **Reporting:** "I saw someone taking photos near the production line - I reported it to security straight away"

### Poor Security Practice ✗
- **Ignoring procedures:** "I held the door open for someone without checking their ID - I assumed they worked here"
- **Information sharing:** "I told a visitor about our customer delivery schedules when they asked"
- **Not reporting:** "I saw something suspicious but didn't want to cause trouble"
- **Careless behaviour:** "I left sensitive documents on my desk when I went to lunch"

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incidents
**If you witness a security breach:**
1. **Ensure your safety** first - don't put yourself at risk
2. **Alert others** if appropriate without causing panic
3. **Contact security** or emergency services as needed
4. **Secure evidence** if safe to do so
5. **Provide statement** to investigating authorities

### Evacuation Procedures
**Security-related evacuations:**
- **Follow evacuation procedures** as trained

- **Cooperate fully** with emergency services
- **Don't re-enter** until officially cleared

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **What should you do if someone asks you detailed questions about our quality control procedures?**
   - Answer: Politely redirect them to appropriate management or Quality department - don't share sensitive operational information

2. **You see someone you don't recognise in the production area without a visitor badge. What are your actions?**
   - Answer: Politely challenge them, ask to see ID/visitor badge, escort them to reception if unauthorised, report incident to supervisor/security

3. **Name three types of information that should be kept confidential.**
   - Answer: Customer specifications, process procedures, personnel details, business information, quality data (any three)

## Simple Practical Activity (10 minutes)

**Security Scenario Assessment:**

1. **Scenario presentation:** Trainer describes various situations
2. **Individual assessment:** Is this a security concern? What would you do?
3. **Group discussion:** Compare responses and identify best practices
4. **Role play:** Practice politely challenging unauthorised individuals
5. **Reporting practice:** How would you report each scenario?

**Example scenarios:**
- Delivery driver asking about customer delivery schedules
- Visitor taking photos of quality certificates on wall
