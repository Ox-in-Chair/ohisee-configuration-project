**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Foreign Body Control

# Glass and Brittle Plastic Control Training

**Module:** Glass and Brittle Plastic Control  
**Audience:** All factory personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 4.9.1, 5.8 Foreign Body Control  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.8 BRCGS Foreign Body Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** glass and brittle plastic items that require control and monitoring
2. **Perform** regular inspections using the Glass and Brittle Plastic Register
3. **Report** damaged or missing items correctly and immediately
4. **Follow** emergency procedures if glass or brittle plastic breaks

## Why Glass and Brittle Plastic Control Matters

Broken glass or brittle plastic fragments can contaminate packaging products, causing serious injury to consumers and leading to costly product recalls. Strict control prevents these foreign bodies from entering products.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (4.9.1):** All practical steps must be taken to identify, eliminate, avoid, or minimise the risk of glass and brittle plastic contamination.

**Kangopak Standard:** All glass and brittle plastic items are registered, regularly inspected, and immediately reported if damaged to prevent product contamination.

## Understanding Brittle Plastic

### What Is Brittle Plastic?
Brittle plastic is hard plastic material that can shatter into sharp fragments when broken, similar to glass. These fragments pose contamination risks to packaging products.

### Examples of Brittle Plastic
- **Acrylic sheets:** Clear plastic panels and covers
- **Polystyrene items:** Rigid plastic components and housings
- **Old plastic covers:** Aged plastic that has become brittle over time
- **Certain instrument panels:** Hard plastic gauges and displays
- **Lighting covers:** Plastic lamp shades and protective covers

### What's NOT Brittle Plastic
- **HDPE containers:** Flexible plastic containers that deform rather than shatter
- **Rubberised components:** Flexible rubber and rubber-like materials
- **Flexible PVC:** Soft, bendable plastic materials
- **Polyethylene items:** Most packaging films and flexible containers

## Glass and Brittle Plastic Register System

## Inspection Process

### What to Look For
1. **Cracks:** Any visible cracks in glass or brittle plastic surfaces
2. **Chips:** Missing pieces or damaged edges
3. **Loose mounting:** Items not securely attached to their supports
4. **Missing items:** Glass or plastic components that have disappeared
5. **Deterioration:** Age-related degradation that increases brittleness

### Recording Findings
- **Condition assessment:** Note current condition of each registered item
- **Defect description:** Clear description of any problems found
- **Risk evaluation:** Assess potential contamination risk from defects
- **Action required:** Specify repair, replacement, or removal needed
- **Timeline:** Set deadline for corrective action completion

### Verification Process
- **Supervisor review:** Team leader or coordinator verifies inspection results
- **Action planning:** Schedule maintenance or corrective actions
- **Documentation:** Ensure all paperwork completed correctly
- **Follow-up:** Confirm corrective actions completed on time

## Practical Factory Examples

### DO's ✓
- **Inspect systematically:** Follow register checklist completely during inspections
- **Report immediately:** Tell supervisor about any damaged glass or brittle plastic
- **Document thoroughly:** Record all findings clearly on inspection forms
- **Act promptly:** Address defects before they become contamination risks
- **Wear protection:** Use appropriate PPE when handling glass materials

### DON'Ts ✗
- **Never ignore damage:** Even small cracks must be reported and addressed
- **Never delay reporting:** Report problems immediately, don't wait until later
- **Never attempt repairs:** Only qualified maintenance personnel should fix glass items
- **Never remove items:** Don't take glass or brittle plastic out of designated areas
- **Never rush inspections:** Take time to thoroughly examine all registered items

## Breakage Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Actions if Glass Breaks
