**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Housekeeping & Cleaning

# Housekeeping and Cleaning Standards Training

**Module:** Housekeeping and Cleaning Standards  
**Audience:** All factory personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 4.9 Housekeeping & Cleaning  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 4.9 BRCGS Housekeeping & Cleaning Rev 15

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** "Clean as You Go" principles throughout your work activities
2. **Use** correct cleaning methods and materials for different areas and equipment
3. **Identify** cleaning frequencies and responsibilities for your work area
4. **Report** housekeeping issues and maintenance requirements correctly

## Why Housekeeping and Cleaning Matter

Proper housekeeping and cleaning maintain hygiene standards, prevent product contamination, and create a safe working environment. Poor cleaning can introduce harmful bacteria, foreign objects, or chemical contamination.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (4.9):** Housekeeping and cleaning systems must ensure appropriate hygiene standards and minimise contamination risk to products.

**Kangopak Standard:** A condition-based "Clean as You Go" policy is maintained across all manufacturing, storage, and ancillary areas including the engineering workshop.

## Clean as You Go Policy

### Core Principle
Clean as You Go means maintaining cleanliness throughout work activities rather than leaving cleaning until the end. This prevents contamination build-up and maintains high standards continuously.

**Key benefits:**
- **Prevents contamination** from spreading or building up
- **Maintains standards** throughout the entire shift
- **Reduces end-of-shift** cleaning time and effort
- **Creates safer** working conditions continuously
- **Demonstrates professionalism** and pride in work quality

### Daily Application
**Throughout your shift:**
- **Wipe spills** immediately when they occur
- **Clear debris** from work areas as it accumulates
- **Organise tools** and materials to maintain tidy workspace
- **Remove waste** regularly, don't let it pile up
- **Check cleanliness** of surfaces you're working on

## Cleaning Standards for Different Areas

### Production Areas
**High hygiene standards required:**
- **Surfaces:** Clean and sanitise all food-contact surfaces
- **Floors:** Sweep and wash, ensure proper drainage
- **Equipment:** Clean according to cleaning schedules
- **Walls:** Keep clean, report damage or staining
- **Lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting is maintained

**Cleaning frequencies:**
- **During production:** Continuous clean as you go
- **Between batches:** Clean equipment contact surfaces
- **Daily:** Complete area cleaning at shift end
- **Weekly:** Deep cleaning of non-daily items
- **Monthly:** Comprehensive deep clean including high areas

### Storage Areas
**Prevent contamination of stored materials:**
- **Raw materials:** Keep storage areas clean and dry
- **Finished products:** Maintain hygiene standards for packed goods
- **Pallets:** Inspect and clean reusable pallets
- **Racking:** Regular cleaning of storage systems
- **Floors:** Clean spills immediately, maintain drainage

### Office and Welfare Areas

## Cleaning Equipment and Materials

### Equipment Selection
**Choose appropriate tools:**
- **Colour-coded equipment** to prevent cross-contamination
- **Food-grade materials** for food-contact areas
- **Proper storage** to keep equipment clean when not in use
- **Regular replacement** of worn or damaged items
- **Personal protective equipment** when handling chemicals

### Colour Coding System
**Standard colour codes:**
- **Red:** Toilets and washroom floors
- **Yellow:** Clinical and washbasins
- **Green:** General food and bar use
- **Blue:** General cleaning (non-food areas)
- **White:** Dairy and bakery

**Never mix colours or use wrong colour in different areas**

### Cleaning Chemicals
**Safe and effective use:**
- **Follow instructions** on chemical labels exactly
- **Use correct dilutions** - more is not always better
- **Personal protective equipment** as specified
- **Proper storage** away from production areas
- **Never mix** different chemicals together

**Key chemicals in use:**
- **Detergents** for removing soil and grease
- **Sanitisers** for killing bacteria and viruses
- **Degreasers** for heavy soil removal
- **Descalers** for mineral deposit removal
- **Specialised cleaners** for specific applications

## Cleaning Methods and Procedures

### Basic Cleaning Steps
**Standard procedure:**
1. **Pre-clean** - remove loose debris and gross soil
2. **Wash** - apply detergent and scrub or wipe surfaces
3. **Rinse** - remove detergent residue with clean water
4. **Sanitise** - apply sanitiser to kill remaining bacteria
5. **Air dry** - allow surfaces to dry naturally where possible

### Equipment Cleaning
**Follow equipment-specific procedures:**
- **Switch off and isolate** equipment before cleaning
- **Disassemble** removable parts as required
- **Clean all surfaces** including hidden areas
- **Reassemble correctly** after cleaning and drying
- **Test function** before returning to production use

### Chemical Application
**Safe and effective use:**
- **Read instructions** before using any chemical
- **Measure accurately** - use measuring devices, not guesswork
- **Apply evenly** to ensure complete coverage
- **Contact time** - allow chemicals time to work effectively
- **Rinse thoroughly** if required by instructions
