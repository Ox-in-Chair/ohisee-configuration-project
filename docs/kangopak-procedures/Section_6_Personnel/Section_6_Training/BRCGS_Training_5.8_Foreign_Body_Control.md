**Kangopak Procedure:** BRCGS Foreign Body Contamination Control

# Foreign Body Contamination Control Training

**Module:** Foreign Body Contamination Control  
**Audience:** All factory personnel  
**BRCGS Reference:** 4.9.1, 4.9.2, 4.9.5  
**Kangopak Procedure:** 5.8 BRCGS Foreign Body Contamination Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** the main types of foreign bodies that could contaminate packaging materials
2. **Implement** prevention strategies to avoid foreign body contamination in your work area
3. **Respond** appropriately when foreign body contamination is discovered

## What Are Foreign Bodies?

Foreign bodies are any objects that shouldn't be in or on packaging materials. They pose serious risks to consumers who might eat food from contaminated packaging, ranging from choking hazards to broken teeth or internal injuries.

**Key BRCGS Requirements:**
- 4.9.1: Glass and brittle materials control
- 4.9.2: Sharps and metal detection/removal
- 4.9.5: Other physical contaminants prevention

**Kangopak Requirement:** Training for all staff on avoidance and detection of foreign bodies including glass, brittle plastic, blades, and any other foreign objects.

## Types of Foreign Bodies

### Glass and Brittle Materials (BRCGS 4.9.1)
**Common sources:**
- **Light bulbs and fittings** that could break over production areas
- **Glass windows or doors** in production areas
- **Brittle plastic components** from equipment
- **Personal items** like glasses or glass containers

**Why dangerous:** Sharp fragments can cause severe cuts, internal injuries, or choking

### Metals and Sharps (BRCGS 4.9.2)
**Common sources:**
- **Worn machine blades** that chip or break
- **Metal fragments** from equipment wear
- **Tools and maintenance items** left in production areas
- **Personal metal items** like jewellery, keys, or coins
- **Staples, paper clips** from office areas
- **Wire or metal strapping** from raw materials

**Why dangerous:** Can cause choking, cuts, broken teeth, or internal puncture wounds

### Other Physical Contaminants (BRCGS 4.9.5)
**Common sources:**
- **Plastic pieces** from packaging, equipment, or personal items
- **Wood splinters** from pallets or wooden equipment
- **Stones or dirt** from poor housekeeping
- **Hair, skin, or nail fragments** from poor hygiene
- **Insects or pest debris** from inadequate pest control
- **Fabric fibres** from clothing or cleaning materials

**Why dangerous:** Choking hazards, contamination concerns, or consumer complaints

## Prevention Strategies

### Personal Responsibility
**What you must do:**
- **Remove all jewellery** except plain wedding rings
- **Secure personal items** in lockers, not production areas
- **Check pockets** are empty before entering production
- **Report loose buttons** or damaged clothing immediately
- **Keep fingernails short** and don't wear false nails or nail polish
- **Use hairnets properly** to prevent hair loss

### Work Area Management
**Daily checks:**
- **Inspect your area** for any foreign objects before starting work
- **Check equipment** for loose parts, worn components, or damage
- **Remove unnecessary items** from production areas
- **Keep tools organised** and account for them at shift end
- **Clean spills immediately** to prevent dirt accumulation
- **Report maintenance needs** that could create foreign body risks

### Equipment and Materials
**Key practices:**
- **Handle raw materials carefully** to avoid creating debris
- **Use tools properly** to prevent breakage or wear
- **Report equipment damage** immediately - don't try to fix it yourself
- **Follow cleaning procedures** that don't introduce new contamination risks
- **Check incoming materials** for foreign objects before use

## Detection and Response

### Regular Inspection
**What to look for:**
- **Visual inspection** of products and work areas throughout your shift
- **Unusual sounds** from equipment that might indicate wear or breakage
- **Changes in product appearance** that might indicate contamination
- **Debris accumulation** in corners or under equipment

### When You Find a Foreign Body
**Immediate actions:**
1. **STOP production immediately** - don't let more product become contaminated
2. **Secure the area** - prevent others from disturbing evidence
3. **Call your supervisor** or Quality team immediately
4. **Document everything** - what you found, where, when, and what you were doing
5. **Quarantine affected product** - separate it from good product
6. **Don't remove the foreign body** - leave it for investigation

### Investigation Process
**What happens next:**
- **Risk assessment** - could other products be affected?
- **Source identification** - where did the foreign body come from?
- **Product review** - how much product needs checking or disposal?
- **Corrective actions** - what needs fixing to prevent recurrence?
- **Documentation** - full record for traceability and improvement

## Practical Factory Examples

### Prevention Success Stories ✓
- **Daily inspection:** "I found a loose screw from equipment during my start-of-shift check and reported it before production started"
- **Personal responsibility:** "My button felt loose so I reported it and got a replacement uniform before entering production"
- **Area maintenance:** "I noticed paint flaking from the ceiling and reported it as a potential contamination source"
- **Tool control:** "We account for all tools at shift handover to ensure nothing is left in production areas"

### What Not to Do ✗
- **Ignore small objects:** "It's only a small piece of plastic - it probably won't matter"
- **Continue production:** "I found glass but finished the batch before reporting it"
- **Remove evidence:** "I threw away the foreign body after I found it"
- **Assume it's okay:** "The foreign body was near the packaging, not in it, so it's fine"
- **Work around problems:** "The equipment is making a new noise but it still works"

## Special Considerations

### Glass and Light Policy
- **Prohibited items:** No glass containers, personal glass items in production
- **Protected lighting:** All lights must have protective covers
- **Regular inspection:** Check light fittings for damage or insect accumulation
- **Breakage protocol:** Specific procedure for any glass breakage incidents

### Metal Detection Systems
- **Understand limitations:** What can and cannot be detected
- **Regular testing:** Daily checks with test pieces
- **Proper response:** What to do when detector alarms
- **Maintenance:** Keep detection equipment clean and calibrated

### Cleaning and Maintenance
- **Appropriate materials:** Use cleaning tools that don't shed fibres or create debris
- **Scheduled maintenance:** Planned equipment maintenance to prevent wear
- **Area inspection:** Check for maintenance debris after any work
- **Documentation:** Record all maintenance activities near production

## Checkpoint Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

1. **You find a small piece of metal near your work station. What are your first three actions?**
   - Answer: Stop production immediately, secure the area, call supervisor/Quality team

2. **Name three personal items that could become foreign bodies if brought into production areas.**
   - Answer: Jewellery, hair accessories, loose buttons, pens, coins, keys (any three)

3. **Why is it important not to remove foreign bodies you find?**
   - Answer: Evidence needed for investigation to determine source and prevent recurrence; risk assessment requires original context

## Simple Practical Activity (8 minutes)

**Foreign Body Hunt:**

1. **Scenario setup:** Trainer places various "foreign bodies" around a simulated work area
2. **Individual inspection:** Each participant inspects the area for foreign bodies
3. **Find and report:** Identify what you found and explain why it's a concern
4. **Discussion:** Compare findings and discuss detection strategies
5. **Prevention planning:** For each foreign body found, discuss how to prevent it in future

**Items might include:**
- Paper clip, button, small plastic piece, hair tie, pen cap, etc.

## What Supervisors Look For

Your supervisor will assess:

- **Awareness** - ability to spot potential foreign body sources
- **Prevention** - proactive actions to prevent contamination
- **Response** - appropriate actions when foreign bodies are found
- **Reporting** - prompt and accurate communication of issues
- **Compliance** - following personal conduct rules (no jewellery, etc.)
- **Continuous vigilance** - maintaining awareness throughout shift

**Detection systems:** Your understanding of how detection equipment works and proper response to alarms.
