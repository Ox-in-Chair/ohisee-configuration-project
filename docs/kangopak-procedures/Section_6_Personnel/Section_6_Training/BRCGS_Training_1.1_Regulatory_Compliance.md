## Why Regulatory Compliance Updates Are Critical

The regulatory environment for food packaging is constantly evolving. New regulations, updated standards, and changing enforcement priorities require continuous monitoring and adaptation. Failure to stay current with regulatory changes can result in non-compliant products, customer rejection, legal penalties, and loss of business.

**Key BRCGS Requirement (1.1.6):** Senior management shall ensure that changes in applicable regulations are monitored and assessed for their relevance and impact on the business.

**Kangopak Standard:** We maintain comprehensive regulatory monitoring systems and ensure all applicable requirements are identified, assessed, and implemented in our operations and products.
