FOREIGN BODY CONTAMINATION CONTROL
Annual Mandatory Training - All Production Personnel
BRCGS Reference: 4.9.1-4.9.5 | Kangopak Procedure: 5.8
Understanding Foreign Body Contamination
Foreign bodies are any objects that shouldn’t be in or on packaging materials. They represent one of the most serious product safety risks because they can cause choking, cuts, broken teeth, or internal injuries to consumers who eat food from contaminated packaging.
Types of Foreign Bodies and Their Risks
Glass and Brittle Materials (BRCGS 4.9.1)
Common sources in packaging factories:
•	Light bulbs and fixtures above production areas
•	Glass windows or doors in production areas
•	Brittle plastic components from equipment or containers

•	Glass cleaning materials like mirrors or gauges
Why extremely dangerous:
•	Sharp fragments can cause severe cuts to mouth, throat, or digestive system
•	Internal injuries from swallowed glass can require emergency surgery
•	Choking hazard especially dangerous for children
•	Legal liability - glass contamination often results in serious legal action
Prevention strategies:
•	No glass policy - no personal glass items in production areas
•	Protected lighting - all lights must have unbreakable covers or be LED
•	Regular inspections - daily checks of all glass fixtures and fittings
•	Immediate reporting - any glass breakage must be reported immediately
•	Quarantine procedures - extensive product isolation after any glass breakage
Metal Contamination (BRCGS 4.9.2)
Common sources:
•	Worn machine blades that chip or break during operation
•	Metal fragments from equipment wear, screws, bolts, washers

PRODUCT SAFETY CULTURE
Annual Mandatory Training - All Personnel
BRCGS Reference: 1.1.2 | Kangopak Procedure: 1.1.1
What Is Product Safety Culture?
Product safety culture is the shared commitment of everyone at Kangopak to making sure the packaging we produce is safe for the food that goes inside it. It’s not just about following rules - it’s about genuinely caring that families can trust the products in our packaging.
A strong product safety culture means that every decision, from the factory floor to the boardroom, considers product safety as the top priority. It’s about creating an environment where everyone feels responsible for safety and empowered to speak up when they see potential problems.
Core Elements of Strong Safety Culture
1. Safety-First Mindset
What this means in practice:
•	Every decision considers product safety impact before cost, speed, or convenience
•	No shortcuts that could compromise product safety, even under pressure

•	Long-term thinking - considering consequences beyond immediate results
Daily examples:
•	Taking time to clean equipment properly even when behind schedule
•	Reporting worn equipment parts before they fail
•	Following procedures completely even when no one is watching
•	Asking for clarification rather than guessing about requirements
2. Personal Ownership and Accountability
Individual responsibility:
•	Everyone owns safety - from production operators to senior management
•	Active participation - looking for ways to improve, not just doing minimum requirements
•	Problem-solving attitude - thinking about how to prevent issues, not just reacting to them
•	Continuous improvement - always learning and seeking better ways to work
Accountability in action:
•	Admitting mistakes quickly so they can be fixed
•	Taking initiative to address safety concerns
•	Following up on reported problems to ensure they’re resolved
•	Taking pride in the safety record of your work area
3. Open and Honest Communication

Communication examples:
•	Reporting near-misses and potential problems before they cause harm
•	Asking questions when procedures aren’t clear
•	Sharing ideas for safety improvements
•	Discussing safety lessons learned from incidents
4. Customer and Consumer Focus
Remembering the end user:
•	Consumer perspective - thinking about families who will eat food from our packaging
•	Customer partnership - working with customers to meet their safety requirements
•	Quality pride - taking personal satisfaction in producing safe packaging
•	Reputation protection - understanding that safety problems damage everyone’s livelihood
Consumer thinking examples:
•	“Would I want my family’s food in this packaging?”
•	“How would I feel if my child found a foreign body in food from our packaging?”
•	“What would happen if this quality issue reached a consumer?”
•	“How can we make this packaging even safer?”

HAZARD & RISK AWARENESS
Annual Mandatory Training - All Production Personnel
BRCGS Reference: 2.1.1 | Kangopak Procedure: 1.1.1
Understanding Hazards and Risks
Basic Definitions
Hazard: Anything that has the potential to cause harm. In packaging production, hazards exist everywhere - from moving machinery to cleaning chemicals to microorganisms. The key point is that a hazard has the potential to cause harm, but doesn’t necessarily mean harm will occur.
Risk: The likelihood that a hazard will actually cause harm, combined with the severity of that harm if it occurs.
Risk = Likelihood × Severity
Why This Matters for You
Understanding the difference helps you:
•	Prioritise your attention - focus on the biggest risks first
•	Make better decisions - choose actions that most effectively reduce risks
•	Communicate effectively - explain safety concerns clearly to supervisors
•	Work more confidently - understand why certain procedures exist and how they protect you
Categories of Hazards in Packaging Production
Physical Hazards
Definition: Objects or conditions that could physically contaminate packaging or cause injury.
Common examples:
•	Metal fragments from worn cutting blades or machinery parts
•	Glass or plastic pieces from broken equipment components
•	Foreign objects dropped or left in production areas
•	Personal items like buttons, hair, jewellery, or nail fragments
•	Maintenance debris left after repair work
•	Sharp edges on equipment or damaged containers
Risk assessment factors:

Risk Assessment Process
Step 1: Hazard Identification
Systematic approach:
•	Walk through your work area and list everything that could potentially cause harm
•	Consider all activities you perform during your shift
•	Think about materials you work with, equipment you operate, and environment you work in
•	Include both routine and non-routine situations like maintenance, cleaning, or emergency response
•	Don’t forget indirect hazards like fatigue, stress, or time pressure
Questions to ask:
•	What equipment could malfunction?
•	What materials could contaminate products?
•	What environmental conditions could change?
•	What human errors are possible?
•	What external factors could create problems?
Step 2: Risk Evaluation
Likelihood assessment:
•	Very likely - happens regularly, perhaps daily or weekly
•	Likely - happens occasionally, maybe monthly or quarterly
•	Possible - has happened before but infrequently
•	Unlikely - rare but theoretically possible
•	Very unlikely - almost impossible under normal circumstances
Severity assessment:
•	Minor - small quality issue, easy to fix, no safety impact
•	Moderate - noticeable quality problem, might affect customer satisfaction
•	Serious - could harm consumers, might require product recall
•	Severe - could cause serious illness, injury, or death
•	Catastrophic - could cause multiple casualties or business failure
Step 3: Risk Rating and Prioritisation
Risk matrix approach: Combine likelihood and severity to determine overall risk level:
Likelihood	Minor	Moderate	Serious	Severe	Catastrophic
Very Likely	Low	Medium	High	Very High	Very High
Likely	Low	Medium	High	High	Very High
Possible	Low	Low	Medium	High	High
Unlikely	Low	Low	Low	Medium	High
Very Unlikely	Low	Low	Low	Low	Medium
Priority actions:
•	Very High Risk - Immediate action required, stop work if necessary
•	High Risk - Urgent action required within 24-48 hours
•	Medium Risk - Action required within 1-2 weeks
•	Low Risk - Monitor and address when resources permit
Step 4: Control Selection
Hierarchy of controls (most effective first):
1.	Elimination - Remove the hazard completely
–	Example: Replace glass components with unbreakable alternatives
2.	Substitution - Replace with something less dangerous
–	Example: Use less toxic cleaning chemicals
3.	Engineering controls - Physical changes to reduce risk
–	Example: Install guards on machinery, improve ventilation
4.	Administrative controls - Procedures and training
–	Example: Inspection checklists, maintenance schedules, training programs
5.	Personal protective equipment - Last line of defence
–	Example: Safety glasses, gloves, protective clothing

•	Severity: Moderate to serious - depending on chemical toxicity and concentration
Risk rating: Medium to high priority
Control measures:
•	Substitution: Use less hazardous cleaning chemicals where possible
•	Engineering: Proper storage and dispensing systems
•	Administrative: Spill response procedures, rinse verification procedures
•	Training: Proper handling techniques and emergency response
Example 3: Pest Contamination
Hazard identification:
•	Insects or rodents could enter production areas
•	Pests could directly contaminate packaging or leave droppings
•	Pest control chemicals could contaminate if not properly applied
Risk evaluation:
•	Likelihood: Unlikely to possible - depends on facility maintenance and pest control program effectiveness
•	Severity: Serious - pest contamination creates significant health risks and customer complaints
Risk rating: Medium to high priority
Control measures:
•	Elimination: Seal entry points, remove pest food sources
•	Engineering: Install door seals, screens, air curtains
•	Administrative: Regular pest monitoring, professional pest control service

Applying Risk Thinking in Daily Work
Before Starting Tasks
Questions to consider:
•	What could go wrong with this task?
•	What materials or equipment am I working with that could create hazards?
•	How can I minimise the risks while still completing the task effectively?
•	What warning signs should I watch for that might indicate developing problems?
Practical application:
•	Check equipment condition before starting
•	Verify that safety procedures are being followed
•	Ensure you have proper protective equipment if needed
•	Plan what you’ll do if problems occur
During Work Activities
Ongoing risk awareness:
•	Monitor conditions - watch for changes that might increase risks
•	Stay alert - fatigue or distraction increases likelihood of errors
•	Follow procedures - understand that shortcuts often increase risks
•	Communicate changes - notify others if you notice new hazards or risks
Risk reduction behaviours:
•	Take breaks when tired to maintain alertness
•	Double-check critical steps in procedures
•	Ask for help when unsure about proper procedures
•	Report equipment problems before they cause contamination
When Problems Occur
Risk-based response:
•	Assess immediately - how serious is this problem?
•	Control exposure - prevent the problem from getting worse
•	Get help appropriately - match the response to the risk level
•	Document thoroughly - provide information needed for proper risk assessment
Response examples:
•	Minor quality defect: Complete current batch safely, report to supervisor
•	Equipment malfunction: Stop work immediately, secure area, notify maintenance
•	Chemical spill: Evacuate if necessary, follow spill response procedures
•	Suspected contamination: Stop production, quarantine product, notify Quality team
Building Risk Assessment Skills
Developing Observation Skills
What to look for:
•	Changes from normal - equipment sounds different, materials look different, processes running differently
•	Wear and deterioration - gradual degradation that increases risk over time
•	Environmental factors - temperature, humidity, cleanliness changes
•	Human factors - stress, fatigue, training gaps that increase error likelihood
Practice exercises:
•	Take a few minutes each shift to systematically look around your work area
•	List three potential hazards and assess their risks
•	Discuss risk observations with colleagues and supervisors
•	Keep a mental note of seasonal or periodic risk changes
Learning from Experience
Personal learning:
•	Reflect on near-misses - what could have gone wrong and how was it prevented?
•	Analyze incidents - what factors contributed to problems that did occur?
•	Study successes - what risk control measures work particularly well?
•	Seek feedback - ask supervisors and colleagues about your risk assessment skills
Team learning:
•	Share observations - discuss risk concerns with colleagues
•	Learn from others - listen to experienced workers’ risk insights
•	Contribute to training - help newer employees develop risk awareness
•	Participating in investigations - contributes to understanding why problems occur

•	Circulation - is there severe bleeding that needs immediate control?
When to call ambulance:
•	Person is unconscious
•	Severe bleeding that cannot be controlled
•	Suspected heart attack or stroke
•	Severe burns or injuries
•	Chemical exposure with serious symptoms
•	Any situation where you’re unsure about severity
Workplace Injury Response
Immediate priorities:
1.	Ensure safety - make sure area is safe before approaching injured person
2.	Assess consciousness - is person awake and responsive?
3.	Call for help - get first aider and call ambulance if needed
