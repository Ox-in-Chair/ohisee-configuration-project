## Understanding Product Safety Issues

### What Makes Products "Unsafe"?
**Contamination risks:**
- **Foreign bodies** in or on packaging (metal, glass, plastic, dirt)
- **Chemical contamination** from cleaning agents, lubricants, or inks
- **Biological contamination** from poor hygiene or pest activity
- **Cross-contamination** from previous products or allergens

**Specification failures:**
- **Dimensional problems** that affect Product Safety (thickness, seal integrity)
- **Barrier property failures** that can't protect food properly
- **Migration issues** where packaging components could transfer to food
- **Functional failures** that make packaging unsafe to use

### What Makes Products "Out-of-Specification"?
**Quality deviations:**
- **Dimensions outside tolerance** (thickness, width, length measurements)
- **Appearance defects** (wrong colour, print errors, surface marks)
- **Functional problems** (seal strength, opening force, barrier performance)
- **Material variations** (wrong grade, properties not meeting requirements)

**Documentation issues:**
- **Missing certificates** or test data for food contact compliance
- **Wrong specifications** used for production
- **Traceability gaps** that prevent proper identification
- **Labelling errors** that could mislead customers or consumers

## When to Report Immediately

### Immediate Safety Risks - STOP PRODUCTION
**Foreign body contamination:**
- **Metal fragments** from equipment wear or maintenance
- **Glass pieces** from broken lights or personal items
- **Plastic pieces** from worn equipment or packaging materials
- **Insects or pest evidence** in or near packaging materials
- **Hair, skin, or personal items** on packaging surfaces

**Chemical contamination:**
- **Cleaning chemical residues** on packaging surfaces
- **Lubricant contamination** from machinery leaks
- **Ink or adhesive** in wrong locations or wrong formulations
- **Strong odours** from packaging that could transfer to food

**Process failures:**
- **Temperature deviations** in heat sealing or sterilisation
- **Pressure problems** affecting seal integrity
- **Equipment malfunctions** that could affect safety
- **Power failures** that interrupted critical processes

### Specification Deviations - ASSESS AND REPORT
**Dimensional issues:**
- **Thickness measurements** outside specification limits
- **Width or length** not meeting customer requirements
- **Seal dimensions** that could affect integrity
- **Component sizes** (spouts, zippers) outside tolerances

**Appearance problems:**
- **Colour variations** beyond acceptable limits
- **Print quality** issues affecting information clarity
- **Surface defects** that could affect food contact safety
- **Package integrity** issues like holes or tears

## Who to Report To

### Designated Managers
**Primary contacts for product safety issues:**
- **Production Supervisor** or Production Manager
- **Quality Manager** or Quality Technician
- **Site Manager** for serious safety issues
- **Shift Leader** if other managers not available

### Escalation Chain
**When primary contact not available:**
1. **Next level supervisor** in the management chain
2. **Any member** of the Risk Team
3. **Senior manager** on duty
4. **Emergency contact** outside normal hours

**Never delay reporting** because the usual contact person isn't available.

### Emergency Contacts
**For serious safety issues:**
- **Risk Team Leader** contact details posted on notice boards
- **Quality Manager** 24-hour contact number
- **Site Manager** emergency contact information
- **Head Office** emergency number for out-of-hours issues

## How to Report Effectively

### Immediate Verbal Report
**Key information to provide:**
1. **Your name** and location
2. **Nature of problem** (contamination, specification failure, etc.)
3. **Product or material affected** with identification details
4. **Quantity involved** (how much product might be affected)
5. **Immediate actions taken** (production stopped, product quarantined)

### Follow-up Documentation
**Written report requirements:**
- **Detailed description** of what you observed
- **Time and date** when problem was first noticed
- **Products or batches** potentially affected
- **Actions taken** to secure products and prevent further problems
- **Any photos** or physical evidence if safe to collect

### Information to Gather
**Before making the report:**
- **Exact location** where problem was found
- **Product identification** (batch numbers, customer details)
- **Material lot numbers** if raw materials are involved
- **Timeline** of when problem might have started
- **Extent of potential contamination** or specification failure

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Continue Production
**Never:**
- **Keep running** hoping the problem will resolve itself
- **Try to sort out** defective products from good ones
- **Wait until break time** or end of shift to report
- **Assume someone else** will notice and report the problem
- **Continue if you're unsure** whether it's a real problem

### Don't Handle Evidence Incorrectly
**Avoid:**
- **Throwing away** contaminated products or foreign objects
- **Cleaning up** contamination before investigation
- **Moving products** without proper identification
- **Taking samples** without proper procedures
- **Disturbing evidence** that investigators might need

### Don't Delay or Downplay
**Never:**
- **Wait to see if more problems occur** before reporting
- **Assume minor problems** don't need reporting
- **Worry about getting in trouble** for reporting problems
- **Let production pressures** prevent proper reporting
- **Think it's not your responsibility** to report what you see
