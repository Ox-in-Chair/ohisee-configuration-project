## Objective

To ensure that where production processes are subcontracted, it is done in agreement with customers and that procedures are in place for the effective control of subcontractors and the work undertaken.

## Method

### Risk Evaluation

Risk evaluations are conducted to establish the degree of control required over the subcontracted production. The type and extent of control are influenced by factors such as:

- The potential impact of the outsourced process on our company's capability to provide product that conforms to specifications
- The degree to which control for the process is shared
- The capability of achieving the necessary control through the application of the purchasing process in line with the company's supplier approval and performance monitoring procedure

### Use of Subcontractors

Customers and brand owners are notified of the use of subcontractors and the status with respect to the Standard.

### Approval of Subcontractors

Subcontractors are categorised as suppliers of materials or services and as such must be approved according to the supplier approval and performance monitoring procedure. (See 3.4)

### Hazard and Risk Analysis

Subcontracted processes are included in the Hazard and risk analysis. Refer to HACCP studies.

### Specifications

Clear specifications are agreed for all work outsourced to subcontractor.

### Control Plans
