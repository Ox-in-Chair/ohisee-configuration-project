## Objective

To ensure that documented procedures and recording forms critical to the management of product safety, legality and quality are in place and effectively controlled.

To ensure that only up-to-date valid documents/data are in use and that obsolete documents are promptly removed from use.

## Method

### Scope of 'Controlled' Documents

Documents which fall under the scope of the Product Safety & Quality Management System (PS&QMS) are listed on a Master Documents and Records Register maintained by the Document Control Function.

These documents are subjected to:

- Formal approval prior loading of documents onto the shared drive as appropriate
- Electronic notification via email transmittal
- Revision highlight by means of colour or font on the revised document
- A record of the reason for any changes or amendments to documents

To ensure that:

- Documents can be located and readily accessible to relevant staff at all times
- Documents are periodically reviewed
- Current documents are available for use and are password protected
- Retained obsolete documents are removed

### Product Safety and Quality Management System Documentation

The following Documentation falls under the scope of "Controlled" documents in the PSQMS and are defined in the following levels:

**Level 1 – Policy**
Product Safety & Quality Manual which is a summary document of the entire PSQM System and includes Policy Statements

**Level 2 - Procedures**
Procedures are documents which define the management and control of the key risks and steps in a process.

**Level 3 – Work Instructions**
Which usually refer to a specific task or operating a specific machine. Standards - documents which define specific standards to be maintained often cross referencing to a national or international standards examples include PPE Hygiene Standard and Personal Hygiene Standard (Food Safety) or Visitors on Site and Grinders Standard (SHE)

**Level 4 – Forms/Templates**
These are for entering of records relating to a specific parent Policy, Procedure or Work Instruction

### Cross Referencing

- Documents are cross referenced to the relevant clause of the standards
- Multiple cross references is applicable to a given Document
- Forms are linked to their parent policy, procedure or work instruction by means of the same parent cross reference and a suffix e.g. parent 5.6, 5.6F1 as preferred
- Documents are uniquely identified by means of their title

### Document Formats

All PSQMS Policies, Procedures and WI's are formatted in a uniform manner. Templates of the various document types are kept by the Administration Manager. The documents contain, as a minimum, the following on each page of the document:

- Document reference – single or multiple as applicable
- Function – the relevant function title
- Date of revision – this is the date that the document went into circulation at the revision number
- Revision – this is the revision number of the document
- Responsibility – the job function that performs the functions defined in the document
- Approved by – the signature of the person who is responsible for managing the function
- Title – the name of the document
- Page x of y – to show the page number of the particular document and how many pages are present in the document

### Registration

Form and document numbers to be allocated by Administration Manager. Documents are then registered on Master List of Documents.

### Approval

Approval is by the authorised signatory and a Master File is maintained.

### Issue

Controlled documents are issued to the Shared drive where it can be viewed but not amended. All relevant personnel are informed of the new document or new revision by means of an email sent by the Administration Manager.

**Digital Messaging Tools (WhatsApp Groups):** For quick and real-time communication, document update notifications will also be sent via designated workgroup chats for operational teams.

It is the responsibility of the Head of Department to ensure that the relevant personnel are trained on the issued document. Training is recorded on a training attendance register and a copy of the register is forwarded to the Administration Manager to verify all relevant personnel has read and understood the procedure.

### Display of Hard Copies

All notices displayed in the factory are to be cleanable and secure. They will be laminated by the Systems Administrator before they are displayed in the factory. Checks are made by means of a GMP Audit which is performed Quarterly.

### Hard Copy/Manual Issue

Hard copies of the approved originals are stamped with a "controlled copy" stamp.

The Training Register is completed and signed by the recipients of the hard copy to acknowledge receipt and to demonstrate that old revisions of the document are discarded.

### Deletion of Document/Form Template

Soft or controlled hard copies of documents or templates to be updated by relevant authorised person and sent via email to Document Controller to update on shared drive, Master List of Documents and distribution within 48 hours.

All obsolete documents to be withdrawn from circulation and removed from records table.

All previous revisions of Documents or Templates are moved to obsolete document folder. This is kept for change history purposes.

### Control of Documents Issued from an External Source/Origin

These documents include items such as relevant international standards and legislation. The control of these documents lies with the issuing body and not the document control function which is responsible only for the maintenance and communication to relevant staff. These documents are stored on a shared drive and recorded on the List of Documents of External Origin.

### Product Specifications

All product specifications are controlled electronically and are PDF protected.

Process specifications are controlled as per this procedure.

### Change Control

A different font colour is used at the area in the document where that change has been made. The revision number and date of the document is updated accordingly. A record of the reason for any changes or amendments to documents. The use of correction fluid is not acceptable.

**Procedure for correcting mistakes in documents as follows:**

1. Line through the incorrect information (make sure the information can still be read)
2. Make the change
3. Initial the change

### Reviewing of Documents

Documents are reviewed as required or as a minimum at time of an internal audit. Refer to the Audit Plan. This Audit Plan is updated at the time of a document addition or deletion to ensure that it reflects the latest scope of System Documentation.

### Protection

All documents and records in electronic form are stored securely (e.g. with authorised access, control of amendments, or password‑protected) and backed up to prevent loss or malicious intervention.
