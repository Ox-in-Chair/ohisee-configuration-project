## Objective

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the methodology based on risk assessment used to determine the susceptibility of packaging and raw materials to food fraud.

## Method

Raw material risk assessment is done on all packaging materials, raw materials and ingredients/processing aids that are received/used at Kangopak as above to identify potential risks to safety and legality.

### Information Gathering

The first stage of a vulnerability assessment is to source reliable information (EU Commission Alerts) regarding the potential adulteration, substitution or mis-labelling of raw materials and the supply chain, on which the assessment can be based. Kangopak subscribe to various sources.

The aim of the assessment is not to assess the potential for fraud at the site, but to examine the supply chain for potential concerns or weaknesses and therefore to identify those raw materials that are of particular risk of adulteration or substitution, so that appropriate controls can be put in place. Kangopak considers what could occur and whether any discrepancies would be noticed during the current goods receipt, quality assurance or testing activities.

A list of raw materials (or groups of raw materials) and the controls (e.g. product testing, traceability systems or supply chain audits) that are already in operation are compiled.

### Vulnerability Assessment

Complete vulnerability assessment out on all raw materials, groups of raw materials or finished product packing materials to assess the potential risk of substitution, adulteration, or misrepresentation. This take into account:

- Historical evidence of substitution, adulteration, or misrepresentation
- Economic factors which may make fraudulent activity more attractive
- Ease of access through the supply chain
- Sophistication of routine and upstream testing
- Physical form
- Supplier relationships
- Adverse impact on the user of the final product
- Nature of the raw material

### Review and Monitoring

The Vulnerability Assessment plan is be kept under review to reflect changing economic circumstances and market intelligence which may alter the potential risks such as:

- A change in the country of origin or the supplier of raw materials
- A change in the financial situation of raw material suppliers or countries of origin
- A change in cost of raw materials, either upwards or downwards
- A change in the supply chain, logistics and delivery of materials
- A change in material availability
- Emergence of a new risk (e.g. known substitution of a raw material)
- Developments in scientific information associated with materials, process or product
- Information received as part of supplier approval (e.g. clause 3.7.2) which highlights new or evolving risks

It is reviewed annually at Management Review.

### Verification of Claims

Barrier performance claims (e.g., OTR) made on specifications are verified via supplier certificates and, where necessary, third-party testing. This ensures authenticity of performance data and prevents fraudulent or misleading claims.

## Implementation Notes

This procedure establishes a systematic approach to identify and mitigate food fraud risks in the supply chain through vulnerability assessments and continuous monitoring. It focuses on raw material authentication and supplier verification to ensure product integrity and prevent economic adulteration.
