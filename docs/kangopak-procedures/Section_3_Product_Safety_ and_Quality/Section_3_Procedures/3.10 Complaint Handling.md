# Procedure 3.10: Customer Complaint Handling

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 10
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Objective

To ensure customer complaints are effectively captured, recorded, investigated, corrective action taken and managed to prevent recurrence of product complaints.

## Method

### Incoming Customer Complaints

Customer complaints are received telephonically, in person or via email communication.

The complaint is forwarded to the Risk Team and the Operations Manager updates the Complaint Register with the complaint details.

The Operations Manager forwards the complaint details to relevant department Team Leader for investigation and close out. Information is gathered from production log sheets and retained sample.

Where available, customer complaint samples are collected from the customer for testing the validity of the complaint.

### Complaint Review, Investigation and Response

If the complaint is valid, the Team Leader performs an investigation with relevant teams and documents the results and corrective actions on the register to be taken which is sent back to the Customer as feedback.

If trends indicate a significant problem, or a complaint represents a significant product safety, legality or quality risk then a root cause analysis is conducted to avoid recurrence. This analysis is made available to the relevant staff.

When a customer complaint is raised and found to be a supplier of raw material issue, a NCA is raised on the supplier. A corrective action from the supplier is required before the customer complaint can be verified & closed out.

Once corrective actions have taken place, this is then verified by the Operations Manager.

Once the Commercial Manager is satisfied that the relevant close outs have been performed the customer complaint deemed closed by the Commercial Manager

If the complaint is found to be invalid, it is noted as such and closed off on the complaint form.

### Monitoring and Tracking of Customer Complaints

Progress meetings are scheduled to ensure compliance to Complaint Handling procedure and to ensure that customers are receiving feedback promptly dependant on the seriousness and frequency of problem.

The cycle time should be no longer than 20 working days for close outs and verification to occur from date the complaint was first received.

In circumstances where corrective actions are out of control of Kangopak (e.g., time to import machine parts) this is documented at Monthly Management Meetings and closed out as and when it can occur.

The Commercial Manager tracks the cycle time of complaint response by assessing every month what complaints have been received and what responses have been returned. The Commercial Manager does this by way of email or in person with relevant personnel.

Communication and Investigation can be summarised below:

Customer Complaints : Communication Plan – See addendum 1

Customer Complaints : Investigation Plan – See addendum 2

### Performance Measures and Reporting

Complaints are discussed at the Management Review meeting where action plans for significant trends are laid out.

Data may include but not limited to the following:

- Number of Complaints Open vs Closed
- Age Analysis
- Categorisation of Customer Complaints
- Detailed breakdown of Categories for Customer Complaints
- Complaints per Work Order
- Complaints per Dimension
- No of Complaints per Customer
- Number of Defective pouches per customer

These are generated on a Complaints Register.
