## Objective

To ensure that processes are in place to determine Customer needs and expectations with regard to quality, safety, legality and ensure these are consistently fulfilled.

## Method

### Customer Related Processes

#### Determination and Review of Customer Requirements

Customer requirements relating to the design, development, specification, manufacture and distribution to the product are developed and defined in conjunction with the customer utilising when required a Customer Questionnaire resulting in a purchase order.

These include:

- Customer specified requirements
- Un-stated requirements necessary for intended use
- Statutory and regulatory requirements for the product/service

Customer requirements are reviewed, prior to commitment to supply a product or service, to ensure that:

- Requirements are defined
- Requirements are agreed
- We have the ability to meet defined requirements

Pouch Specification Form is completed and signed off by Customer.

Records of the review and resulting actions are maintained. Changes to Customer requirements are recorded, reviewed and agreed. Where necessary, relevant documents are amended accordingly.

Where customers have set particular performance criteria or indicators for monitoring, these requirements are communicated to relevant staff via job cards.

Any amendments to existing Customer Questionnaire/Printed Pouch Checklist are recorded on a Pouch Specification Form.

A new Pouch Specification Form is drawn up and signed off by the Customer. Changes are recorded on the revision table.

The approved Pouch Specification Form is then forwarded to the Operations Manager via email outlining amendments.

The Operations Manager will then update Job Card before distribution to Production.

#### Customer Communication

Customer Complaints and Non-Conformance reports are reviewed and reported in the monthly management meeting.
