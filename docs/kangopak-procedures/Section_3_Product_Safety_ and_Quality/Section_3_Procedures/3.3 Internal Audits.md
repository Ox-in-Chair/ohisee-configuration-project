**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 12
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Director
**Status:** Current

## Purpose

To evaluate:

- Compliance with standards, procedures, process and systems effectiveness
- To drive the incremental improvement

## Method

### Internal Audit Plan

An Internal Audit plan is generated annually and defines:

- The specific requirement and process / procedure to be audited
- The frequency in relation to the risks associated with the activity / process
- Root cause analysis shall be used to determine appropriate corrective actions
- Status of audits

The Internal Audit System is structured to cater for operational and systems audits:

### GMP Audits

GMP audits focus on compliance and effectiveness of operational good manufacturing practices and procedures on the factory floor. A departmental specific checklist is used and corrective action is recorded in the event of a noncompliance.

These audits are conducted as per audit plan by the Manager/Director and findings are discussed in management meetings.
The results shall be reported to the personnel responsible for the activity or area audited. Corrective actions, and timescales for their implementation shall be agreed.

### Process/Procedure Audits

These audits are conducted on documented Product Safety and Quality processes in accordance with the audit plan. These audits focus on compliance & effectiveness of procedures.

Process/procedure specific checklists are developed, maintained and used by the auditor.

### Supplier and Sub contractor Audits

The requirement of these audits is specified in the Supplier approval and performance monitoring procedure and subcontractor of production procedure respectively.

### Systems Compliance Audit

This audit is conducted annually using the Systems checklist to ensure all aspects of the product safety and quality management system are reviewed. This includes a review of all policies, documentation, hygiene and production.

As a minimum, the scope of the Systems Compliance Audit programme will include the:

- HARA or product safety and quality plan, including the activities to implement it (e.g. supplier approval, corrective actions and verification)
- prerequisite programmes (e.g. hygiene, pest control)
- product defence and product fraud prevention plans
- procedures implemented to achieve the Standard and modules.

When necessary, this audit may be scheduled more than once per year on the basis of the recurring non-conformances, customer complaints, increasing in audit non compliances.

This audit is conducted by a person independent of the department being audited.

## Training/Allocation of Internal Auditors

All Internal auditors are trained in relevant auditing techniques.
The allocated audits may be done by one Auditor, but preferably two Auditors
One Auditor is designated as the "Lead Auditor"
Auditors are independent of the department being audited
Lead Auditors are chosen on the basis of experience in the area to be audited and results of auditor competence evaluation

### Systematic Approach to Audits

Previous Audit Reports (where available) and Audit Checklists are used to ensure a systematic approach during each audit.

These audits are captured on the Internal Audit database or audit report. The Internal Audit reports are distributed as relevant and the originals are retained and filed.

## Preparing for an Internal Audit

Based on the Internal Audit plan which is available, the Auditor finalises the audit data with the auditee.

The auditor prepares prior to the audit as follows:

- The auditor prints out Internal Audit Report from database (if applicable)
- Develop/review the relevant checklist

## Conducting an Internal Audit

The audit is conducted by the Audit Team in conjunction with the relevant responsible personnel hosted by the head of department.

### Recording

All findings are recorded on the relevant audit checklist and findings sheet specifically highlighting:

- Non-compliances found
- The action required
- The due date and person responsible for the action to be conducted
- The acknowledgement of the findings by the Auditee.

Internal audit reports are sufficiently detailed to ensure that conformity as well and non-conformity is identified and verified.

### Scoring

Each checklist question is scored as follows:

- Full Compliance: 3
- System Failure: 0

### Categorisation of Findings

To facilitate analysis & interpretation findings are categorised. These categories include:

- Documentation
- Records
- Plant/Technology
- Business Process
- People - Behaviour
- People – Training

The score and outcome/conclusion of the audit are captured by the Lead Auditor on the Audit Database.

## Action Required (Auditee)

It is responsibility of the Auditee to rectify the deficiencies highlighted by the Internal Audit Report.

These findings are corrected as soon as possible to enable the auditor to follow-up and close-out the audit.

Corrective and preventive actions, and timescales for their implementation shall be agreed and their completion verified.

The Auditee shall document the root cause analysis as well as the corrective actions taken for each audit finding.

## Action Required (Auditor)

Each audit finding is to be followed up and closed out within a maximum of at least of 45 days. The completion of corrective action is recorded and verified by the auditor.
Audit findings open after 45 days are to be escalated to a NCA and audit findings closed by reference to the NCA number.
