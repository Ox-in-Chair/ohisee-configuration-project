1. **OBJECTIVE**

Establish a procedure that ensures all product batches are identifiable and that all raw materials can be traced through each step of processing, especially in continuous processes, where the highest practical level of accuracy is maintained.

This procedure also aims to facilitate the distribution of the finished product to the customer and ensure that records are promptly retrievable.

1. **METHOD**
   1. **Extent of Traceability**

The means of identification and the extent of traceability are mapped using a table. (refer overleaf).

All raw materials from the supplier through all stages of processing and distribution of the finished product and vice versa are traceable.

* 1. **Product Identification**

Kangopak reviews the label content for all materials used throughout our operations to ensure accuracy and compliance. These reviews ensure that each category of material—whether raw materials, work-in-progress, finished products, or non-conforming goods—is consistently labelled according to the latest standards.

* + 1. **Finished Goods**

The finished product is identified through a carton label.

**Finished Goods – Pouches & Spouted Pouches**

Each carton label displays the following information: Customer (if applicable), Product Code, Description, Work Order Number, Carton Number, Quantity per Carton, Net Weight of Carton (weight of the finished product), and the initials of the person who packed the carton.

* + - 1. **Customer Product Identification System for Finished Goods**

Customers can identify and trace Kangopak's products using the Work Order (WO) number and Carton Number, both displayed on the labels of finished goods cartons. This method facilitates precise product and production lot identification and ensures accurate traceability and reliable product identification. As a result, it enhances customer support, satisfaction, and compliance with traceability standards.

* + 1. **Raw Materials**

The raw material is identified through a Supplier or ‘Returned to Stores’ label.

Each label includes the following information: Width, Supplier Work Order Number, Reel number, Gauge, Weight, Description, Previous Work Order number (only returned to stores label) & batch number (Zipper)

* + 1. **Work-in-Progress**

The identification of WIP products is done through a blue carton label. Each WIP carton label displays the following information: Customer (if applicable), Product Code, Description, Work Order Number, Carton Number, Quantity per Carton, Net Weight of Carton (weight of the finished product), and the initials of the person who packed the carton.

* + 1. **Finished Goods Carton Liners**

Carton Liners are identified using a supplier label, which includes the following details: Production Date, Product Size, Product Batch Number, and Quantity.

These traceable details are recorded on the machine's Production Log Sheet, indicating that the liners are used for packaging finished products.

Blue Liners must not be used as "process waste bags/carriers" for Finished Goods.

Should any Blue Liners be found in use for this prohibited purpose, the Incident Reporting process must be initiated to prevent future occurrences.

* + 1. **Non-Conforming Products – Raw Materials, WIP & Finished Goods**

A red 'ON HOLD' label is used to identify non-conforming products and quarantined goods. Each label contains the following information: Supplier Work Order Number, Reel Number, Material Description, Material Gauge, Reel Width, Reel Weight, Non-conformance Number, Rework Instruction, Kangopak Work Order Number (for Finished Goods), Pouch Dimensions, Pouch Quantity, and Carton Numbers.

* 1. **Label Generation for Finished Goods & WIP**

The Operations Manager and Warehouse Team Leader generate and print labels for finished goods and WIP. This task pertains to label requirements for the pouching, spouting, and slitting departments. Team leaders or staff from these departments cannot print labels without proper authorisation to avoid issues such as production nonconformances, material mishandling, double printing, and clerical errors.

Should labels be needed, departments must first approach the Warehouse Team Leader. If labels cannot be obtained from the Warehouse Team Leader, the next point of contact is the Operations Manager, who will ensure labels are printed promptly to maintain traceability.

Failure to comply with this protocol may result in disciplinary action**.**

* 1. **Slitting Operations Identification**

All materials resulting from slitting operations MUST be labeled immediately with full traceability information.

This requirement applies to ALL materials including Work In Progress (WIP).

Labeling Requirements for Slitting:

1. Each output reel/roll from slitting operations must be individually labeled
2. Labels must be applied IMMEDIATELY upon creation - before operator leaves the station
3. WIP status does not exempt materials from immediate labeling requirements
4. No unlabeled materials may be left at the end of any shift

Minimum Label Information:

1. Original WO number
2. Reel/roll number (e.g., 1 of 4, 2 of 4)
3. Date of slitting operation
4. Operator initials
5. Status (WIP or Finished Goods)

**Segregation:** Different batches resulting from slitting operations must be physically segregated to prevent mixing and maintain traceability integrity.

THE PRINCIPLE "SPLIT IT? LABEL IT!" APPLIES TO ALL SLITTING OPERATIONS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

* 1. **Traceability Test**

The traceability system is rigorously tested on a predetermined annual basis to ensure comprehensive traceability from raw materials to the finished product and vice versa. This testing process evaluates the system's capability to accurately track and record the flow of materials throughout all stages of production and distribution.

It confirms that traceability can be maintained efficiently for each product, from raw material acquisition to the finished product.

Additionally, the system ensures that all records associated with traceability are retrievable promptly. Results from these tests are meticulously documented, reviewed to identify areas for improvement, and retained.

This documentation makes the results readily available for internal audits and regulatory inspections, thereby ensuring continuous enhancement of the traceability process and ongoing compliance and system integrity.

* 1. **Rework and Reworking Operation \*\*\*\***

All reworked products are identifiable and traceable, maintaining their linkage to the original batch and enhancing overall traceability integrity.

This approach supports compliance with regulatory requirements and upholds quality standards across your operations.

* 1. **Performance Measures and Reporting**

The extent of traceability during a traceability test, recall or mock recall exercise. The records and trends are reviewed and analysed at the annual management review**.**
