## Objective

To ensure a plan and systems are in place to effectively manage any incidents, product withdrawals, returns from customers and recalls, in order to ensure that all potential risks to the quality, hygiene, safety and legality of products and the final customer are controlled.

## Method

### Definitions

- **Incident:** An event that has occurred that may result in the production or supply of unsafe, illegal or non-conforming products
- **Non-conformance:** A deviation from specified requirements
- **Customer Complaint:** Any dissatisfaction that has been experienced by a customer
- **Product recall:** The removal of unsafe, out-of-specification or illegal product from the supply chain. This includes product in the possession of the customer
- **Product withdrawal:** Any measures aimed at achieving the return of out-of-specification or unfit product from customers, but not from final consumers
- **Quarantine:** The status given to any material or product set aside while awaiting confirmation of its suitability for intended use or sale

### Risk Team

The Director formally appoints a Risk Team. Refer to the Appointment letters. The Risk Team consists of key personnel and any legal representation considered necessary. The Operations Manager is the designated Recall Co-ordinator. The members of the Risk Team, together with their phone numbers, are listed and available at Reception as well as displayed around the premises in case of emergencies.

### Incident Reporting

#### Receiving of Information

**Information received from factory operations**

A product recall can be initiated if a product safety, quality defect or illegal product in finished product is detected after the product is despatched from factory site.

**Information received from external sources**

The complaint source could be from customers, suppliers, or other external body

The following information is obtained: (See Product Recall Form 3.11F1)

- Date and time of information received
- Caller's details (name etc.)
- Contact numbers and address details
- Full product description
- Date of Production
- Job Number
- Purchase Order Number
- Carton Number
- Nature of problem
- Quantify how much product is affected

#### Identification & Isolation of Unused Product

The Risk Team representative requests in writing that any unused portion of the product still in the supply chain be labelled and safely stored until collection by company representatives.

#### Decision on What Action to Take

The Operations Manager arranges for the Risk Team to meet. (The Director is the alternate for this position, should the need arise).

The team assesses all the information available and decides if the recall classification is Class I, II or III.

**CLASS I (Emergency Situation):** This is a high risk health hazard situation where it is known that the product will cause serious health consequences or injury.

**CLASS II (Priority Situation):** Involves a potential health hazard situation where there is a minor risk of adverse health consequences from the product.

**CLASS III (Commercial Situation):** The product does not meet acceptable company quality standards and poses no adverse health risks.

Immediate actions of the Company Risk Team include the following:

- Stop further distribution of affected product
- Locate and then quarantine stock in the supply chain
- Notify authorities
- Notify customers within 48 hours
- Locate all stock not accounted for i.e. in the trade

When all the stock has been accounted for, the requirements for storing the quarantined product, isolation of stored product and for the eventual disposition (rework, disposal, resale etc.) of the product are defined.

The corrective action taken, how any disruption to manufacturing capacity will be dealt with, resolution and Method of Disposal are recorded on the withdrawal form.

Communication with regulatory bodies and customers as per communications procedure.
