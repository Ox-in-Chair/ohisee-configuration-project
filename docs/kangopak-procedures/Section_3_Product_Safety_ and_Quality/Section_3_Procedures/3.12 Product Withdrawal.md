# Procedure 3.12: Product Withdrawal Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 4
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

---

## Objective

To ensure a plan and systems are in place to effectively manage any incidents, product withdrawals, returns from customers and recalls, in order to ensure that all potential risks to the quality, hygiene, safety and legality of products and the final customer are controlled.

## Method

### Definitions

- **Incident:** An event that has occurred that may result in the production or supply of unsafe, illegal or non-conforming products

Incidents may include: disruption to normal production processes, disruption to key services such as water, energy, transport, refrigeration processes, staff availability and communications, events such as fire, flood or natural disaster, malicious contamination or sabotage, failure of, or attacks against, digital cyber-security and global pandemic outbreaks.

- **Non-conformance:** A deviation from specified requirements
- **Customer Complaint:** Any dissatisfaction that has been experienced by a customer
- **Product recall:** The removal of unsafe, out-of-specification or illegal product from the supply chain. This includes product in the possession of the customer
- **Product withdrawal:** Any measures aimed at achieving the return of out-of-specification or unfit product from customers, but not from final consumers
- **Quarantine:** The status given to any material or product set aside while awaiting confirmation of its suitability for intended use or sale

### Risk Team

The Director formally appoints a Risk Team. Refer to the Appointment letters. The Risk Team consists of key personnel and any legal representation considered necessary. The Operations Manager is the designated Withdrawal Co-ordinator. The members of the Risk Team, together with their phone numbers, are listed and available at Reception as well as displayed around the premises in case of emergencies.

### Incident Reporting

#### Receiving of Information

**Information received from factory operations**

A product withdrawal can be initiated if a product safety, quality defect or illegal product in finished product is detected after the product is despatched from factory site.

**Information received from external sources**

The complaint source could be from customers, suppliers, or other external body

The following information is obtained: (See Product Withdrawal Form)

- Date and time of information received
- Caller's details (name etc.)
- Contact numbers and address details
- Full product description
- Date of Production
- Job Number
- Purchase Order Number
- Carton Number
- Nature of problem
- Quantify how much product is affected

#### Identification & Isolation of Unused Product

The Risk Team representative requests in writing that any unused portion of the product still in the supply chain be labelled and safely stored until collection by company representatives.

#### Decision on What Action to Take

The Operations Manager arranges for the Risk Team to meet. (The Director is the alternate for this position, should the need arise).

The team assesses all the information available, incident severity, impact and actions to be taken and decides if the withdrawal classification is Class I, II or III.

**CLASS I (Emergency Situation):** This is a high-risk health hazard situation where it is known that the product will cause serious health consequences or injury.

**CLASS II (Priority Situation):** Involves a potential health hazard situation where there is a minor risk of adverse health consequences from the product.

**CLASS III (Commercial Situation):** The product does not meet acceptable company quality standards and poses no adverse health risks.

Immediate actions of the Company Risk Team include the following:

- Stop further distribution of affected product (actions required to effectively manage an incident to prevent release of product were product safety, legality or quality may have been affected)
- Recovery including logistics for return, storage of recovered product and product disposal
- Locate and then quarantine stock in the supply chain
- Notify customers within 48 hours

When all the stock has been accounted for, the requirements for storing the quarantined product, isolation of stored product and for the eventual disposition (rework, disposal, resale etc.) of the product are defined.

The corrective action taken, how any disruption to manufacturing capacity will be dealt with, resolution and Method of Disposal are recorded on the withdrawal form.

Communication with customers as per communications procedure.

In the event of a significant product safety or legality incident, the site shall notify the current certification body within 3 working days.

Kangopak will ensure to provide sufficient information to enable the certification body to assess any effects of the incident on the ongoing validity of the current certificate within 21 calendar days. As a minimum, this shall include corrective action, root cause analysis and a preventive action plan.

## Emergency Preparedness – Contingency Planning

The following contingencies are identified and controlled based on risk to product safety, legality, and quality. All personnel involved in incident management (Risk Team) are trained in this procedure annually or when updated.

### Accidental, Malicious Contamination, or Sabotage of Product

- Unauthorized access to open product areas is controlled (locked areas, visitor sign-in, staff awareness)
- Staff trained to report suspicious people, vehicles, theft, vandalism, or sabotage immediately
- Incoming shipments inspected for tampering
- In case of suspected tampering, operations stop and Risk Team coordinates investigation, containment, and notification

### Product Failure or Significant Non-Conformity

- Risk Team investigates any major product failure, customer complaint trend, or regulatory non-conformance
- Product is quarantined, assessed, and recalled/withdrawn if necessary (see full withdrawal process)
- Root cause analysis is carried out, and preventive measures implemented

### Disruption to Key Services or Normal Manufacturing Operations

**(Water, Energy, Distribution, Personnel, Communications)**

- **Power outage:** Generator available; production halts; NC product discarded as waste once restarted; inverter used for canteen and offices
- **Water disruption or contamination:** Production halts until potable water restored or trucked in; health authorities notified if contamination suspected; facility remains closed until approved to reopen
- **Distribution disruption:** Deliveries rescheduled in consultation with customers
- **Labour unavailability (strike, illness):** In such situations, it is possible that supplies/means of production/Deliveries of product are affected. In such conditions Kangopak in consultation with the Customer may choose to provide the consignment at reschedule delivery period
- **Communication loss:** If communication lines are out of service Kangopak has the facility to pick up communication via the internet and cell phones. These numbers are available to clients

### Fire, Flood, or Natural Disaster

- **Flood:** Product moved to safe storage out of the way of contaminated water; Thoroughly wash all the equipment and utensils with soap and water, using hot water if available
- **Fire, earthquake, tornado, or high-wind damage:** Site closed; employees sheltered; area inspected for glass/debris; damaged or contaminated stock discarded; customers informed to arrange alternatives

### Failure of, or Attacks Against, Digital Cyber-Security

- Regular back-ups maintained offsite by Management
- In case of malware, attack, or system failure, back-ups are restored; IT support engaged to secure systems

### Outbreaks/Pandemic

- Kangopak will review latest information from reliable sources
- Ensure that necessary controls for provision of safe water, sanitation and hygienic conditions are in place and monitored
- Where necessary information and guidance will be disseminated to staff
- This can be done by ways of induction, staff meeting, emails, production meeting etc.

### Environmental Fallout

The site's primary waste is plastic punch-outs. Normally contained and recycled.

Any uncontrolled release or spillage (e.g., stormwater contamination, external escape) is treated as an incident:

- Staff notify Supervisor and Operations Manager immediately
- Material is contained, collected, and disposed of or recycled as per waste procedures
- Incident logged and, if necessary, reported to authorities
- Preventive measures (containment improvements, awareness) implemented

### Post Withdrawal Review

A post withdrawal review is carried out to conduct root cause analysis and implement appropriate improvements as required.

Where products have been released from the site that could be affected by an incident, the need to withdraw products and, where appropriate, advise customers to withdraw and/or recall products, will be considered.

### Annual Mock Withdrawal Exercise

An annual mock withdraw exercise to validate the withdrawal procedures is conducted. This will only be conducted if a real withdrawal has not been experienced over the preceding 12 months. The results of the tests shall be retained and shall include timings of key activities.

### Performance Measures/Reporting

- Number and nature of Product withdrawals (if any)
- Status feedback on mock withdrawal exercise in Management Review

### Risk Team Roles

The incident management procedure shall be capable of being put into operation at any time.
