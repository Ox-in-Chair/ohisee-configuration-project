## Objective

To ensure that appropriate specifications exist for raw material, Work-in-Process and finished products, and any product or service which could affect the integrity of the finished product and customer requirements.

## Method

### Raw Materials

Raw material specifications and/or material data sheets are obtained from suppliers based on where required by the Supplier Risk Assessment.

All relevant COC's are kept together with the delivery notes. Refer to Raw Material Specifications Register.

### Finished Goods

Product specifications are approved by the Operations Manager, Director and Customer where relevant, to ensure each specification is suitably detailed, accurate and in compliance with relevant product safety and legislative requirements. Refer to Pouch Specification Form.

Where specifications are not formally agreed upon then Kangopak will ensure that steps have been taken to put an agreement in place with the customer. This will be done via email and/or purchase orders based on approved quotes that detail finished goods specification and pricing.

#### Custom Finished Products

For custom items that are sold, the Director agrees upon the specification together with the Customer. The Operations Manager is consulted if the need arises. The specification is detailed on a Pouch Specification Form that is signed off by the Customer as being finalised.

The signed off Pouch Specification Form is available in hardcopy and/or PDF format on the shared drive.

Specifications for custom finished goods are changed as and when required by the customer and the Pouch Specification form is updated. The Specifications change table is filled in to indicate the most recent date of change and what changes occurred. The amended Pouch Specification Form is sent to the customer who will sign it off as being finalised.

#### Standardised Stock Finished Products

For standardised stock items that are sold, the Director and the Operations Manager agrees upon the specification and this specification is available upon request. The specification is detailed on a Pouch Specification Form that is signed off by the Director as being finalised. The Pouch Specification is available in both hardcopy and PDF format on the shared drive.

Specifications for standardised stock are changed as and when required by Kangopak and the Pouch Specification form is updated. The Specifications change table is filled in to indicate the most recent date of change and what changes occurred. These Pouch Specification Forms are made available to customers that purchase these stock items upon request by the customer.

### Trademarked Goods

Trademarks for application on packaging materials are formally agreed between relevant parties. This is done so by the approval by customer of final artwork proofs with trademarks or logo.

Die line/Work maps are drawn up by the Operations Manager. These die lines/work maps are sent through to the raw material supplier, who will be printing the material, together with the final artwork received from the customer in PDF format.

If the customer wishes to superimpose the artwork onto the die line/work map themselves the die lines/work maps are sent through to the customer. This work map/die line will be sent through to the raw material supplier once received back from the customer.

Kangopak does not collate any artwork on behalf of the customer.

The raw material supplier will have artwork proofs made up.

This artwork proof will be sent back to Kangopak. The Operations Manager must ensure that the raw material will be printed in such a way, as seen on the proof, that it will meet Kangopak's production capabilities.

Once Kangopak is satisfied with the artwork this artwork is sent to the customer. The customer will sign off to verify the artwork if everything is satisfactory. If any amendments are required another proof will need to be made by the raw material supplier and this proof must be signed off by the customer.

Once the signed off artwork proof is received, it is sent back to the raw material supplier, for the origination of plates/stereos to occur.

The Printer will then inform Kangopak of the dates and time of the On Press Approval (OPA) process.

During the OPA process, the Customer or designated proxy will be present to approve the print standard.

Once the Customer or designated proxy is satisfied that the print conforms to their requirements, they will give final approval to proceed with the printing of the job by signing the "1st offs"

Customer approved "1st offs" from initial OPA of printed material/colour standards are filed and retained by the Printer for future reference.

In the event of the Customer making amendments to the artwork proof, the proofs are reworked by the printer and resubmitted to the Customer for final approval.

### Work-In-Process (Intermediate Goods)

The Work in process (WIP) that Kangopak has is the pouches that need to have spouts inserted/attached to them. These pouches have the same characteristics as Finished Products.

WIP specification are handled the same way as Finished Product Specifications for pouch making.

A Pouch Specification Form is signed by the customer for spouted pouches. From this Pouch Specification Form a job card for the production of these pouches is generated. Once they are produced they are packed into a carton and this carton is identified with a BLUE label to ensure easy identification and to reduce the risk of cross contamination.

Once the WIP is complete it is stored in the warehouse. When it is needed a Job Card for the Spout Inserting machine/s is generated as per the signed Pouch Specification Form. On this job card the traceability information is inputted and the specification of the WIP is indicated to ensure that the correct WIP is utilised in order to produce Finished Goods to required specification.

### Certificate of Conformance (Statement of Compliance)

A Certificate of Compliance is maintained, which includes the following:

- The nature of the materials used in the manufacture of the packaging, Material Specification
- Dimension of product and position of features. i.e. Euro Slot Tear Nick, Zipper

## Records

- Raw Material Specifications Register
- Pouch Specification Forms
- Certificate of Conformance
- Artwork Approval Records
