# Procedure 3.4: BRC Supplier Approval Performance Monitoring and the Management of Suppliers of Services

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 12
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Operations Manager
**Status:** Current

## Objective

To ensure that Suppliers are initially evaluated and approved and subsequently monitored (ongoing assessment) to ensure that procured materials and services conform to defined requirements.

Where services are outsourced, the service is appropriate and any risks presented to product safety, quality or legality have been evaluated to ensure effective controls are in place.

## Method

### Scope

These controls are applied to any materials or services that affect product safety, legality and quality, i.e. raw materials, including finished product packing materials.

### Risk Analysis/Assessment

Risk assessments are conducted on all procured items and services by the Operations Manager as & when required with the aid of a Risk Assessment model which plots Severity, Likelihood & a resultant Risk Rating.

**Factors (Defined Requirements) considered include:**

- **Product Quality** – the impact on Quality of this Category of Supplied item
- **Product Safety** – the impact on product safety of this Category of Supplied item
- **Legal** – the impact on Legislative compliance of this Category of Supplied item

The Risk Level identifies priorities where focus will be placed in terms of Risk Management.

These are recorded on the Supplier Risk assessment model.

### Scope and Nature of Controls

#### Supplier Approval Process

The Risk Level identified will determine what prerequisites must be in place in order to complete the approval process as per below:

**High Risk:**

- Approval required
- Supplier Questionnaire required
- Globally Recognised Product Safety Certification or Audit required
- Demonstrated Product Compliance and Product Specification required
- Confirmation that products supplied are safe and legal, e.g. declaration of compliance
- On-going monitoring

**Medium Risk:**

- Approval required
- Contract or SLA in place required or Specifications required or Certification or Demonstrated Product Compliance
- On-going monitoring

**Low Risk:**

- No approval required

Suppliers deemed non-critical, such as suppliers of utilities like water and electricity provided by the State and where sufficient controls are in place, are registered on the Creditors System and are excluded from the Risk Assessment.

The Risk Assessment Model is updated with the outcome of the risk and the appropriate controls relevant to the supplier in question.

Where applicable, agreements with suppliers of services are in place which clearly define service expectations and ensure potential risks associated with the service have been addressed.

### Supplier Raw Material Traceability

Kangopak requires that its suppliers of raw materials have an effective traceability systems. Where a supplier has been approved based on a questionnaire instead of certification or audit, verification of the supplier's traceability system will be carried out on first approval and then at least every 3 years. Supplier Raw Material Traceability Summary to be completed.

Where raw materials are purchased from companies that are not the manufacturer or packer (e.g. purchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler), Kangopak will know the identity of the last manufacturer or packer. Information to enable the approval of the manufacturer or packer will be obtained from the agent/broker or directly from the supplier, unless the agent/broker is certificated to the relevant Global Standard.

### Approved Suppliers

Upon successful completion of the approval process defined, these Suppliers are recorded in the Approved Suppliers List.

### Supplier Performance Monitoring

Based on the Risk Assessment Model, the relevant monitoring program is established. Suppliers are reviewed at a minimum annually including analysis of Supplier Non Conformances, Site Audit findings or Customer Complaints.

Supplier review is performed at Management Meetings and Annual Management Review Meeting.

In the event that the supplier's performance is considered to be unacceptable, formal communication with the supplier is entered into & in the event of a lack of corrective action, the supplier may no longer be approved to supply.

### Exceptions to the Supplier Approval & Monitoring Procedure

The Supplier Approval Process is the same regardless of the need to use alternative suppliers or any other exceptions that should arise.

#### Procurement in Emergency Situations

It may be necessary to use emergency suppliers of raw materials, processing aids or packaging materials, in order to gain confidence of a potential new supplier the following is done:

- Check for existing certifications and audit report to review
- Where necessary, remote audits will be considered
- Research online searches for issues or information
- Where applicable request product samples and specifications for assessment
- Assessment of incoming materials (e.g. certificates of analysis, statements of compliance or testing)

All information obtained as the basis of approval is documented for future reference. Update relevant system documentation for new emergency suppliers.

### Supplier & Subcontractor Audit Reports

Where Supplier Audits and Subcontractors of production are required to be performed the audit should cover at a minimum the following:

- Product Safety
- Traceability
- HARA Review
- Good Manufacturing Practises (Prerequisite Controls)

The audit will be undertaken by an experienced and demonstrably competent Product Safety Auditor.

## Performance Measures and Reporting

The following are analysed & trended at the Annual management Review:

- Number & nature of NC's & supplier audit results trended & analysed with a view to evaluate Continuous Improvement
