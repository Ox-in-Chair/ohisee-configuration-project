TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

**BISPHENOL A (BPA) FOOD SAFETY COMPLIANCE STATEMENT**

This is to certify that the materials supplied by Kangopak are manufactured without the intentional presence of Bisphenol A (BPA), as identified by CAS number 80-05-7.

Based on comprehensive information from our raw material supplier, Liqui-Box, and our product composition knowledge, we confirm that our products are formulated without using BPA. Although the products are not routinely tested specifically for BPA, our stringent quality control processes and supplier assessments ensure that this substance is not expected to be present.

We remain committed to ensuring the highest safety and compliance standards in all our manufacturing practices.

Yours faithfully
