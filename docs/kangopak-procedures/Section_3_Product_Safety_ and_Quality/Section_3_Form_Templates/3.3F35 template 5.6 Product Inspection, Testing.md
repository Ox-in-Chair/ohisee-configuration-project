| **Date** | **Sign** |
| Product inspection, testing and measuring | Are quality checks performed to demonstrate that finished product is within established tolerances and conforms to legal requirements? Is the frequency of checks in accordance with industry- accepted practice and based on risk analysis? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Has a hazard risk analysis been conducted to determine the need for in line testing equipment? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Is there a process in place to verify in line testing equipment? Is accuracy specified? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Are there procedures established for the operation, routine monitoring and testing of equipment used for inspection, testing and measurement? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Are routine off line quality checks conducted at appropriate stages of production to ensure product is within agreed tolerances? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Where automated inspection equipment (e.g. vision systems) is used to check print or other material features, the site shall establish and implement procedures for the operation and testing of the equipment to ensure that it is correctly set up and capable of alerting or rejecting the packaging when it is out of specification.  As a minimum, testing of the equipment shall be completed at:  ·         the start of the production run  ·         the end of the production run  ·         a frequency based on the site’s ability to identify, hold and prevent the release of any implicated materials should the equipment fail (e.g. during the production run or when changing batches of raw materials). |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | The site shall establish and implement procedures in the event of a failure in the equipment (e.g. a documented and trained manual checking procedure). |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Is there a procedure to ensure reliability of test results?  Test methods, analytical methods and customer-approved reference samples (where required) shall be of the most recent version and be available in the laboratory or where off- line testing is conducted. Samples shall be suitably stored to avoid degradation. |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| When subcontracting analysis performed on product, has the subcontracted laboratory gained recognized accreditation?  The significance of the laboratory results shall be understood and acted upon accordingly. |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Procedure easily accessible | Is this procedure easily available on the electronic and hard copy format? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Latest procedure live on system and hard copy available | Review the header - is it the latest revision, check that the dates and signatures are present on the hard copy Is it a controlled copy? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Natural work group trained | Have the relevant people been trained on this procedure? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Up to date records table | Is the Records table up to date? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Record compliance | Select a key Records input and verify compliance.  Correct revision in use?  If records are changed after initial recording/entry, are changes clearly legible (errors marked through and initialed); recorded in ink, not pencil? Free of “correction fluid”? |  | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| **VERIFICATION OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS** | | | | | | |
| Has the necessary corrective action (s) been taken (with consideration of root cause)? | | | | YES | NO | N/A |
| Has the cause of the problem (s) been removed? | | | | YES | NO | N/A |
| Has the necessary documentation been revised where applicable? | | | | YES | NO | N/A |
| Has the necessary training been provided, if required? | | | | YES | NO | N/A |
