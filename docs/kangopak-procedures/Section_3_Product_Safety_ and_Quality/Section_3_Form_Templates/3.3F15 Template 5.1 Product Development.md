Client specifications have been updated with the correct parameters, team review of system documents i.e. product development process not finalized yet. | 0 |  |  | |  |  |  |  |
| Customer requirements | Are customer requirements relating to design, development, specification, manufacture and distribution documented and agreed to?  Are critical-use parameters such as barrier and testing parameters defined? | As per customer requirements on the questionnaire (3.2F2), the concept brief was recorded. Critical use parameters were identified as volume, product, and type of filling. These requirements were used to develop the pouch specification form and material data sheets. | 3 |  |  | |  |  |  |  |
|  | Is there a documented procedure that defines when a production trial is required? Are trials and testing carried out validating that manufacturing processes are capable of producing a safe and legal product to the required quality? | Production trials are scheduled under the following conditions: during the development of new products, when there is a customer requirement, for risk assessment, to revalidate process controls and to ensure that new production techniques are maintained. | 3 |  |  | |  |  |  |  |
|  | Is production carried out using defined operating conditions to ensure safe, legal products of the prescribed quality? | SOPs are in place for production processes and operating conditions are defined according to the Production log sheet, which serves as the process specification (5.3F4). | 3 |  | |  |  |  |  |  |
| Technical Product specification | Are technical product specifications prepared and agreed to, with customer or brand owner before the production process begins? | The Pouch Specification Form (5.1F1) has been developed based on the responses received from the customer questionnaire. | 3 |  | |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Is a process in place to ensure the final product concepts and artwork are formally accepted by the specifier, where possible? | 3 |  | |  |  |  |  |  |
| Retention samples | Are samples indicating conformance retained for future reference? | According to the Process Control Procedure (5.3, Revision 11, dated 19 April 2022), sample retention involves keeping retained samples at a predetermined frequency of every 2 hours for post-job analysis whenever needed, such as in the case of a customer complaint. For each production run, if necessary, first-off samples are retained from each shift. The retention sample reference for the RIC Pouch with WO Number KP8977CHM dated 26.01.2023 – CBP 160  Pouch samples KP7977 180 x 300 x 108 – 12:30 | 3 |  | |  |  |  |  |  |
