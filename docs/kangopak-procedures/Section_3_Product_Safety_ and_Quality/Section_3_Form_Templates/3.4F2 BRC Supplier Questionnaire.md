Union by Council Directive
78/142/EEC. To ensure a safe
product, the residual content of
VCM in the finished material or
article is limited to 1mg/kg.
Furthermore, VCM should not be
detectable in foodstuffs.

If material contains PVdc , evidence of
migration needs to be supplied and that PVdc is
not  in direct contact with food or food stuff.

Provide a compliance letter of declaration that
VCM in supplied packaging material does not
exceed the limits imposed by 78/142/EEC;

safer alternatives for PFOA, the U.S.
EPA and eight companies involved in
its manufacturing, committed to
reduce global emissions and the use
of PFOA by 2010/1015. Packaging
