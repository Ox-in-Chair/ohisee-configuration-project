| Vehicle Inspection | Vehicles are equipped with well maintained, clean containers for transportation. Vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by national or subnational governments in many countries, in which a vehicle is inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations governing safety, emissions, or both. Inspection can be required at various times, e.g., periodically or on transfer of title to a vehicle. If required periodically, it is often termed periodic motor vehicle inspection; typical intervals are every two years and every year.\n\n |
| Loading Control | Baskets / modules are carried to the transport vehicle smoothly by a forklift, without causing unnecessary stress to the birds. Forklift trucks must be driven in an appropriate manner. Crates / modules are loaded smoothly onto the vehicles. Noise levels are minimised during loading and unloading. |
| Temperature Control during Transport | Correct temperatures for transport, Verification checks & Recording of temperatures |
| Temperature Control during Storage | Correct temperatures for storage, Verification checks & Recording of temperatures |

| Legislative compliance | Master list of legislation and current Gap Analysis with action plans & due dates. Subscription service assuring communication of updates & amendments. |
| Set up checklist | Record of key process variable settings, line specific, verified by operator/team leader and QA verification. Individual line items require quantitative or qualitative completion, ticks not accepted. |
| 1st off display | Visually displayed unit of production, timed, dated & approved by team leader. |

| Defect Tagging | Defect tags by means of visual display showing defective item, date & time. |
| CCP Display | CCP display boards in standard format displayed as appropriate. |
| CCP Monitoring | CCP monitoring records demonstrating continuous / high frequency monitoring, verified by QA. |

| Statistical Process Control | Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an effective method of monitoring a process through the use of control charts. Control charts enable the use of objective criteria for distinguishing background variation from events of significance based on statistical techniques. Much of its power lies in the ability to monitor both process center and its variation about that center |

## System
| Control Element | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Planned maintenance | The planned maintenance systems are usually comprehensive preventive maintenance programs including machinery, workshops, accommodation |
| PRP Requirements (Codex) | Good Manufacturing Practices to be implemented ( Best Poultry Practices : Cleaning & Sanitation, Design & Facilities, Personnel Hygiene, Bio-security, Pest Control, Transportation, Training, Product Information & Consumer Awareness) |
| Food Safety Audits | Activity audits, daily/weekly |
| Total Integrated Management System (TIMS) Audits | Auditing the TIMS system procedures eg : Doc & Data, Control of Records, Control of Non-conforming, Corrective Actions, Internal Audit Procedures etc |
| Value Engineering Audits | Value engineering is a systematic method to improve the "value" of goods and services by using an examination of function. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to cost. Value can therefore be increased by either improving the function or reducing the cost. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements |
| Stock Rotation | Inventory control, Eg: First In, First Out (FIFO) |
| Product Identification & Traceability | To include: Start / finish time of loading, Farm and slaughter house address, Vehicle departure / arrival time at plant, Reg’ number of vehicle, Driver, Catching Team. |
| CCP Audits | Critical Control Point (CCP) is a point, step or procedure at which controls can be applied and a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable (critical) levels. The most common CCP is cooking, where food safety managers designate critical limits |
| Third Party Certification | Audits to be conducted by accredited certification body |

| Performance Management System | Performance measurement is the process of assessing progress toward achieving predetermined goals. Performance management is building on that process, adding the relevant communication and action on the progress achieved against these predetermined goals.[ |
| HACCP | Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety and pharmaceutical safety that addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards as a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection. HACCP is used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so that key actions, known as Critical Control Points (CCP's) can be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of the hazards being realized |
| FMEA | A Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a procedure for analysis of potential failure modes within a system for the classification by severity or determination of the failures' effect upon the system. It is widely used in the manufacturing industries in various phases of the product life cycle and is now increasingly finding use in the service industry as well. Failure causes are any errors or defects in process, design, or item especially ones that affect the customer, and can be potential or actual. Effects analysis refers to studying the consequences of those failures |
