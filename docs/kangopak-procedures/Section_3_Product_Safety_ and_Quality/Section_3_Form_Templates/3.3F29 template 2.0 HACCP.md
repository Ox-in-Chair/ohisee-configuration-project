Records for L Schlachter, G Gant, M Schlachter, and C Schlachter, dated 17 August 2022, have been reviewed. Additionally, HACCP and BRC Packaging Training documentation are maintained on file.. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Are team members suitably trained in HACCP and kept up to date with factory changes and customer requirements as they occur? | Team Member Training Records: M. Schlachter completed HACCP training on 19 March 2012. L. Schlachter underwent HACCP training on 18 March 2012. G. Gant successfully finished Intermediate HACCP training on 17 February 2015.  The Hazard and Risk Management Team maintains current knowledge on process modifications and aligns with both factory updates and customer needs. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Terms of reference/Clearly defined scope of the hazard and risk analysis management system | Is the scope of the hazard and risk analysis clearly defined and documented? | The scope is documented on 2.0 Hazard analysis and Risk assessment as: The conversion of printed and plain flexible laminates (PET/LLDPE, BO  Nylon/LLDPE) and metallised plastic laminates (MET PET/LLDPE) into stand-up  (doy-packs), folded gusseted, 3-side seal, quad seal and spout pouches for food, beverage, personal care, pet care and industrial applications.  Slitting and rewinding various raw material reels or film for the eventual use as raw material on the pouch making machines. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Does the HACCP program scope covers all products and processes? | The product range includes:   * Stand-up pouches (also known as doy pouches) * Flat pouches * Spout pouches * Quad seal pouches   Additionally, there has been a recent expansion to encompass Personal Care products. Primarily, these pouches are produced for the food, liquid, and industrial markets, encapsulating a wide array of items. This includes but is not limited to nuts, biltong (a form of dried meat), various sauces and spices, coffee, chemical products, soups, assorted confectionery and sweets, agricultural seedlings, and now, skin and personal care products. The construction of these pouches involves a variety of laminates, which are comprised of polyester and linear low-density polyethylene. These materials can be customized to be printed or plain, metallised, coated, or uncoated, based on the specific packaging requirements. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Does the scope make mention of any HACCP guidance used, historical and known hazards associated with specific processes, RM or intended use of the product, known likely product defects that affect safety or quality, details of relevant codes of practice/guideline documents or legislative requirements? | The reference terms and guidelines address several potential risks to the product, including the unintended migration of substances, the threat of tampering, and issues related to the use of recycled materials. These considerations align with the Codex Alimentarius and other pertinent regulatory and statutory requirements. Recent additions under hazards section 2.4.5 and the updated 2.0 BRC HACCP Assessment highlight:  Recent updates to the HACCP study have introduced specific limitations: Resealable Zipper Restrictions: The resealable zipper cannot ultimately serve as the sealing method during the distribution and retail stages. A heat seal must be applied above the zipper for proper closure.  Mishandling and Misuse: To address potential leakage caused by using the zipper as the final seal, a designated control measure must be implemented. This ensures an adequate final seal to prevent any leakage through the zipper or otherwise during commerce.  Labeling Instructions: The updated guidance specifies the use of color-coded labels for easy identification of product status: Blue Labels: Designated for Intermediate products (Work in Progress).  Orange Labels: Indicate Non-Standard Quality products.  Red Labels: Reserved for products that are Held for Segregation as Non-conforming. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Product description | Is there a full description of products produced?  Does it include: composition, origin of raw materials including use of recycled material and intended use of the packaging materials and restrictions on use eg direct contact with food or other hygiene sensitive products or , physical or chemical conditions? | Product description includes: End Product Characteristics. Intended use described as Packaging of liquid and dry products, safe for use in food, beverage, industrial, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Updated to included personal care products. Restrictions on use documented i.t.o of high temperature and high acidity, products with MET PET construction best suited for dry goods. Recent update on restrictions include : Labeling Instructions: The updated guidance specifies the use of color-coded labels for easy identification of product status:  Blue Labels: Designated for Intermediate products (Work in Progress).  Orange Labels: Indicate Non-Standard Quality products.  Red Labels: Reserved for products that are Held for Segregation as Non-conforming. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Flow diagram | Has a detailed flow diagram been drawn up for each product, product group or process?  Is it current? | The flow diagram is structured in a tabular format, detailing process steps, variables, product attributes, as well as the inputs and outputs. This document was last reviewed and updated on 24 August 2022. Following this, the annual Hazard Analysis and Risk Management (HARM) review took place on 25 August 2023. Despite no changes being implemented, enhancements were identified from the analysis of nonconformity reports and observations made during site inspections. These enhancements include improvements in process control, such as checks on gusset punches, enhanced fanning and inspection processes, and the use of sharpened punches. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Does the flow process include the following, where revelant:  \*Receipt and approval of artwork  \* receipt and preparation of raw materials such as additives, inks and adhesives  \* each manufacturing process step  \* in-line testing or measuring equipment  \* The use of rework and post-consumer recycled material  \* any subcontracted operations  \* customer returns | The process flow initiates with the approval of suppliers and then progresses to the approval of artwork, where considerations such as price, quality, and quantity are taken into account, resulting in the product specification being determined.  Material receipt is another step, requiring an incoming inspection or a Certificate of Conformance (COC).  Inline testing was excluded during the hazard analysis, in favor of conducting manual quality checks offline.  The use of recycled materials is explicitly avoided, as noted in the product description. Additionally, no subcontracting is involved in the process.  Documentation of customer returns includes specific process variables such as quantity, description, job number, carton number, and customer details. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Is the accuracy of the process flow been validated by the hazard and risk analysis team? Records available?  Where and how is flow diagram confirmed | The annual Hazard Analysis and Risk Management (HARM) Review took place on 25 August 2023. This comprehensive review encompassed evaluations of changes in materials, adjustments stemming from non-conformities, customer complaints, product failures, recalls, test results, product withdrawals, and internal inspections related to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), as well as audits. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Conduct a hazard analysis | Have **all FS hazards** that are reasonably expected to occur in relation to the type of product, type of process and actual processing facilities been identified and recorded? | Food safety hazards evaluated include microbial, foreign body, chemical, and quality concerns. Additionally, an analysis of sensitive raw materials was completed, assessing risks associated with all utilized raw materials such as reel stock, zippers, blue plastic liners, splicing tape, corrugated cartons, and pallet wrap.  Covered process risks encompass product damage during transit, trademark infringement, use of non-food grade chemicals, contamination from wood chips due to broken pallets, and microbial contamination arising from product handling by staff. Recent updates to hazards include process defects, foreseeable misuse by consumers, and the potential for fraud concerning raw materials, alongside updates to control measures. Discussion on improvements focused on blade control, e.g. by the vertical bar web trimmer process, which was addressed in the Refresher Training on 4 September 2023. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Has the team determined whether existing PRP's (GMPs) are adequate to control the hazards that have been identified? | The GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) audit review, finalized during the Risk meeting on 25 August 2025, found that current GMP measures are satisfactory for maintaining control, with no issues identified. GMP assessments are incorporated into the internal audit timetable, with the Director conducting quarterly GMP audits. The most recent audit records, including the May 2023 audit, utilized a scoring system out of 12. This review noted that floors were properly screeded and painted, although some areas were missing yellow demarcation tape or it was in disrepair. Additionally, there were observations of punch out debris on the floor and evidence of bird feathers. The evaluation also included trending analysis on nonconformances. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Determine Critical Control Points (CCP’S | Has the Codex Alimentarius decision tree or equivalent model been used to determine CCPs? | Following a hazard assessment, a decision tree rooted in HACCP principles is applied, comprising five essential questions. This process did not identify any Critical Control Points (CCPs). | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Did each identified hazard undergo a systematic consideration? | Yes, all identified hazards undergo thorough analysis. This is in accordance with the methodology outlined in section 2.4 of the BRC HACCP Assessment Procedure, Revision 10, dated 28 August 2022. This procedure encompasses all potential hazards that are reasonably anticipated to occur, both with incoming raw materials and at each stage of the product and process. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| How are the hazards that are not controlled by CCP’s addressed? | The Process Control Procedure (Revision 10) establishes additional preventive actions and serves as a guiding framework for overseeing manufacturing operations. It introduces precise control points within the manufacturing workflow to assure thorough oversight.  Controls related to each phase of the process are exhaustively defined. The procedure involves identifying and managing specifications for essential process variables, which are then recorded on the job card along with the specifications for the pouches. To ensure the confidentiality and integrity of this information, the job card is both created and secured using password encryption.  For instance, to prevent the use of incorrect materials, a documented process includes checks at short intervals and requires initialing the job card as a form of verification. Similarly, the risk of blade chips or broken fragments is mitigated by a documented procedure that mandates blade inspections prior to the commencement of each shift, ensuring a smooth handover. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Establish critical limits for each CCP | Have critical limits been defined and validated to ensure that product is safe? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Establish a monitoring system for each CCP | Is a monitoring system defined to ensure compliance to critical limits? Are records and documented procedures maintained and included in internal audits when required? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Do monitoring procedures contain the details on how the measurements are taken and the frequency? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Are monitoring records signed by the person conducting the task and are they verified by an authorized person? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Establish a corrective action plan | Has any corrective actions required for CCP failure been detailed and documented by the HACCP team? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Have the corrective actions been properly defined such that control is regained? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| How has the authority for corrective action been assigned? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Are investigation reports available when monitoring indicates that a deviation has occurred? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Has all staff members tasked with the monitoring of CCPs received detailed, recorded training against the latest version of the relevant procedure? | No CCP’s identified | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Review of HACCP plan | Is the HARM and prerequisite programmes reviewed at least annually or following any significant incidents or when any process changes? Are there records of scheduled HACCP reviews? | The annual Hazard Analysis and Risk Management (HARM) review took place on 25 August 2023. Despite no changes being implemented, enhancements were identified from the analysis of nonconformity reports and observations made during site inspections. These enhancements include improvements in process control, such as checks on gusset punches, enhanced fanning and inspection processes, and the use of sharpened punches. The review included input from GMP Inspections which notes that that floors were properly screeded and painted, although some areas were missing yellow demarcation tape or it was in disrepair. Additionally, there were observations of punch out debris on the floor and evidence of bird feathers. The evaluation also included trending analysis on nonconformances. | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Has the HACCP plan operation been verified to be effective and include a review of:   * Product changes * Product composition changes * Complaints * Product failures * Finished product recalls from consumers (incl system tests) * Product withdrawals * Results of internal audits of prerequisite programmes * Results from external and third-party auditors * New developments in industry associated with materials, process or product | 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
