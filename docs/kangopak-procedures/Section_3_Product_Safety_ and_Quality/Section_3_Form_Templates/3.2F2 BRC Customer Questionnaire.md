KANGOPAK – TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These terms govern all orders with Kangopak, whether for standard stock items or custom-
manufactured pouches. These terms are binding once a formal quotation is accepted or a purchase
order is submitted.

PAYMENT AND ORDER PROCESSING

Cash account orders must be paid fully via EFT or COD before goods are released. Kangopak must
verify proof of payment. To initiate this process, a pro forma invoice must be requested.

For custom pouches, lead time begins only after a purchase order is received and payment is
confirmed. The typical timeframe is 20 working days—10 to 15 for raw material procurement and 5
for production. Stock orders are processed within 48 hours of payment confirmation. Picking and
invoicing occur within the first 24 hours.

Kangopak takes no responsibility for delays caused by late payment, incomplete forms, or delivery
issues resulting from inaccurate customer-provided details. The customer is responsible for
maintaining accurate and current records.

STOCK AVAILABILITY, CALL-OFF TERMS, AND STORAGE RISK

Kangopak carries standard unprinted pouch sizes, with MOQS starting from one carton. The carton
quantity varies by pouch size. Inventory is subject to availability. Customers are advised to maintain a
sufficient buffer stock to cover supply gaps for up to two weeks.

Orders exceeding 30,000 units may qualify for preferential pricing under a fixed three-month call-off
agreement. Deliveries are split evenly across the period. No ad hoc call-offs are permitted.
Alternatively, the full quantity may be produced and delivered upfront, with extended terms by
written agreement. Kangopak will not carry holding costs on behalf of the customer.

PRODUCT USE AND STORAGE CONDITIONS

Coated substrates—such as CBP and metallised films—are suitable for dry goods only. Unless
confirmed in writing, they are inappropriate for hot filling or liquid products. Zipper closures are not
suggested for liquid content and may result in leakage, delamination, etc.

Customers must conduct their migration testing. Usage outside the intended application or without
proper validation voids any claim against Kangopak. Products must be stored between 5–35°C in dry
conditions, away from sunlight. Shelf life is six months from delivery. The customer is responsible for
the shelf life of the contents packed in the pouches.

QUANTITY TOLERANCES AND CARTON COUNTS

All orders are subject to a standard tolerance of ±10%. Any overrun is invoiced at the agreed unit cost.
Quoted prices apply only to stated quantities; changes may require re-quotation. All quotes exclude
VAT unless otherwise specified.

Carton counts may vary from 250 to 10,000 units depending on pouch size. Variances may arise due to
weight differences caused by material thickness tolerances during film manufacture. While manually
packing and counting parcels in each carton, the final pouch count is validated using a calibrated
counting scale. As a result, cartons may include minor over- or undersupply. This is not intentional. If a
shortage can be proven, Kangopak will make up the difference.

PRINTING, PROOFING, AND PRODUCTION

No printing will proceed without an approved final artwork proof. For gravure and Flexo, origination
costs are invoiced upon sign-off and must be paid upfront. The lead time for plate or cylinder
manufacture is approximately two weeks.

Digital printing requires no origination fee. Where applicable, on-press approval includes the first 30
minutes on-site free. Additional time is billed at R5000/hour per supplier's terms.

The standard lead time for printed pouches is 4 to 6 weeks from receipt of the final proof and PO for
planning purposes. Printed jobs cannot be rushed.

Minimum order values apply to all printed jobs. Local deliveries are free. National deliveries are ex-
works and dispatched within 2–3 working days post-production. Special delivery requests require
written approval and may carry added charges.

LIABILITY AND CLAIMS

Kangopak operates under strict hygiene standards. No returns are accepted due to the risk of
contamination from allergens, foreign matter, or microbes.

Customers are required to retain all carton labels, traceability records, and testing results. Missing
documentation invalidates any claims. The customer is solely responsible for product suitability, safe
use, and correct storage.

Kangopak assumes no liability for indirect, consequential, or incidental losses arising from delays,
misuse, product incompatibility, or unauthorised modifications.

Terms are subject to change without notice. Continued engagement constitutes acceptance of the
current terms.
