summary: |
  Establishes procedure ensuring all product batches are identifiable and raw materials traceable through each step. Covers product identification systems, label generation controls, traceability testing (less than 4 hours), and rework traceability.

key_requirements:
  - Map traceability extent for all raw materials through all stages
  - Use standardized labeling systems (Finished Goods, Raw Material, WIP blue, On Hold red)
  - Control label generation through Warehouse Team Leader and Operations Manager only
  - Conduct annual traceability tests demonstrating less than 4 hours trace time
  - Maintain traceability for reworked products linked to original batch

scope: "All products from raw material receipt through processing, storage, and distribution"

integration_points:
  - "3.7 Specifications - Raw Material and Product Specification integration"
  - "5.3 Process Control - Production Log Sheets and Job Cards"
  - "3.11 Product Recall - traceability supports rapid recall"
  - "3.12 Product Withdrawal - enables product isolation"

critical_elements:
  - Customer traceability via Work Order and Carton Number
  - Finished Goods labels (white) with full identification
  - Raw Material labels with supplier details
  - WIP labels (blue) preventing cross-contamination
  - On Hold labels (red) with NC Number
  - Blue Liner controls recorded on Production Log Sheet
  - Label generation authorization restricted
  - Annual traceability testing (less than 4 hours)
  - Rework traceability maintaining batch linkage

# Procedure 3.9: Traceability Procedure

**Company:** Kangopak
**Document Type:** Operational Procedure
**Revision:** 10
**Revised Date:** 2025-09-02
**Document Owner:** Commercial Manager
**Status:** Current

---

## Objective

Establish a procedure that ensures all product batches are identifiable and that all raw materials can be traced through each step of processing, especially in continuous processes, where the highest practical level of accuracy is maintained.

This procedure also aims to facilitate the distribution of the finished product to the customer and ensure that records are promptly retrievable.

## Method

### Extent of Traceability

The means of identification and the extent of traceability are mapped using a table. All raw materials from the supplier through all stages of processing and distribution of the finished product and vice versa are traceable.

### Product Identification

Kangopak reviews the label content for all materials used throughout our operations to ensure accuracy and compliance. These reviews ensure that each category of material—whether raw materials, work-in-progress, finished products, or non-conforming goods—is consistently labelled according to the latest standards.

#### Finished Goods

The finished product is identified through a carton label.

**Finished Goods – Pouches & Spouted Pouches**
Each carton label displays the following information: Customer (if applicable), Product Code, Description, Work Order Number, Carton Number, Quantity per Carton, Net Weight of Carton (weight of the finished product), and the initials of the person who packed the carton.

**Customer Product Identification System for Finished Goods**
Customers can identify and trace Kangopak's products using the Work Order (WO) number and Carton Number, both displayed on the labels of finished goods cartons. This method facilitates precise product and production lot identification and ensures accurate traceability and reliable product identification.

#### Raw Materials

The raw material is identified through a Supplier or 'Returned to Stores' label.

Each label includes the following information: Width, Supplier Work Order Number, Reel number, Gauge, Weight, Description, Previous Work Order number (only returned to stores label) & batch number (Zipper).

#### Work-in-Progress

The identification of WIP products is done through a blue carton label. Each WIP carton label displays the following information: Customer (if applicable), Product Code, Description, Work Order Number, Carton Number, Quantity per Carton, Net Weight of Carton (weight of the finished product), and the initials of the person who packed the carton.

#### Finished Goods Carton Liners

Carton Liners are identified using a supplier label, which includes the following details: Production Date, Product Size, Product Batch Number, and Quantity.

These traceable details are recorded on the machine's Production Log Sheet, indicating that the liners are used for packaging finished products.

Blue Liners must not be used as "process waste bags/carriers" for Finished Goods.

Should any Blue Liners be found in use for this prohibited purpose, the Incident Reporting process must be initiated to prevent future occurrences.

#### Non-Conforming Products – Raw Materials, WIP & Finished Goods

A red 'ON HOLD' label is used to identify non-conforming products and quarantined goods. Each label contains the following information: Supplier Work Order Number, Reel Number, Material Description, Material Gauge, Reel Width, Reel Weight, Non-conformance Number, Rework Instruction, Kangopak Work Order Number (for Finished Goods), Pouch Dimensions, Pouch Quantity, and Carton Numbers.

### Label Generation for Finished Goods & WIP

The Operations Manager and Warehouse Team Leader generate and print labels for finished goods and WIP. This task pertains to label requirements for the pouching, spouting, and slitting departments. Team leaders or staff from these departments cannot print labels without proper authorisation to avoid issues such as production nonconformances, material mishandling, double printing, and clerical errors.

Should labels be needed, departments must first approach the Warehouse Team Leader. If labels cannot be obtained from the Warehouse Team Leader, the next point of contact is the Operations Manager, who will ensure labels are printed promptly to maintain traceability.

Failure to comply with this protocol may result in disciplinary action.

### Traceability Test

The traceability system is rigorously tested on a predetermined annual basis to ensure comprehensive traceability from raw materials to the finished product and vice versa; or more frequently as determined by risk or customer requirements. Each test will cover all product groups, including any outsourced operations, and will confirm traceability forward (finished product to customer) and backward (finished product to raw materials).

This testing process evaluates the system's capability to accurately track and record the flow of materials throughout all stages of production and distribution.

Traceability must be demonstrated within 4 hours unless otherwise specified by local legislation or customer requirements. All test results are retained for audit and review.

### Rework and Reworking Operation

All reworked products are identifiable and traceable, maintaining their linkage to the original batch and enhancing overall traceability integrity.

This approach supports compliance with regulatory requirements and upholds quality standards across your operations.

## Performance Measures and Reporting

The extent of traceability during a traceability test, recall or mock recall exercise. The records and trends are reviewed and analysed at the annual management review.
