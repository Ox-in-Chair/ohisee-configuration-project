================================================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

Non-Conformance (NC): Product, material, or process that does not meet
  specified requirements, customer specifications, or regulatory standards.

Quarantine: Physical separation and identification of non-conforming product
  to prevent unintended use, processing, or distribution.

Disposition: Management decision on how to handle non-conforming product
  (rework, concession, downgrade, scrap).

================================================================================
5. PROCEDURE
================================================================================

5.1 IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When non-conforming product is detected:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTION (within 5 minutes)
   - Stop using/processing the affected product
   - Physically separate from conforming product
   - Alert Team Leader immediately

2. TEAM LEADER ACTIONS (within 1 hour)
   - Create NCR in OHiSee system with:
     * NC description (what went wrong, how detected)
     * Quantity affected (units, kg, batches)
     * Location (line, warehouse area)
     * Product details (SKU, batch number, production date)
     * Detection method (visual inspection, metal detector, customer complaint)
   - Assign unique NCR number (auto-generated: NCR-2025-0001)
   - Notify QA Manager and Production Manager via system alert

5.2 QUARANTINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHYSICAL QUARANTINE (immediate):
1. Move non-conforming product to designated Quarantine Area (Warehouse Zone Q)
2. Use physical barriers (red tape, pallets) to separate from normal stock
3. Attach red "QUARANTINE" labels to all affected units showing:
   - NCR number
   - Date quarantined
   - Quantity
   - Reason for quarantine
   - "DO NOT USE" warning

SYSTEM QUARANTINE (within 2 hours):
1. Update inventory system to block stock from picking
2. Create quarantine hold in traceability system (Procedure 3.9)
3. Send quarantine notification to:
   - Production planning (to prevent further processing)
   - Warehouse (to prevent dispatch)
   - Procurement (if raw material affected)

VERIFICATION:
- Team Leader verifies physical and system quarantine complete
- QA Manager approves quarantine within 4 hours

5.3 INVESTIGATION (within 24 hours)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QA Manager conducts root cause investigation:

STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION
- Review NCR details and supporting evidence (photos, test results)
- Interview operators who detected NC
- Review production records (job cards, quality checks, line clearance)
- Check if previous similar NCs exist (trend analysis)

STEP 2: IDENTIFY AFFECTED BATCHES
- Use traceability system to identify all potentially affected product:
  * Same raw material lot
  * Same production shift/line
  * Same time period
  * Products using same equipment/tooling
- Quarantine all identified affected batches
- Document traceability exercise in NCR

STEP 3: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Use structured approach (5 Whys or Fishbone diagram):

Example 5 Whys:
1. Why did seal fail? → Sealing temperature too low
2. Why was temperature too low? → Operator adjusted setpoint
3. Why did operator adjust? → Thought it would prevent scorching
4. Why did operator think this? → Not trained on seal parameters
5. Root Cause: → Inadequate training on seal temperature control

Document findings in NCR including:
- Root cause statement
- Contributing factors
- Evidence supporting conclusion
- Photos, measurements, test results

STEP 4: ASSESS FOOD SAFETY RISK
Classify NC by severity:
- CRITICAL: Food safety risk (contamination, allergen, foreign body)
  → Notify Site Manager immediately
  → May require customer notification/recall
- MAJOR: Quality/legality issue (incorrect labeling, out of spec)
  → Customer notification if product shipped
- MINOR: Appearance/cosmetic issue
  → Internal handling only

5.4 DISPOSITION (within 48 hours of NCR creation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QA Manager determines appropriate disposition:

OPTION 1: REWORK
- Reprocess product to meet specifications
- Requires:
  * Rework procedure documented
  * Verification that rework brings product into spec
  * Re-inspection after rework
  * New batch code assigned
- QA Manager approval required
- Example: Re-seal bags with seal failures, re-label incorrect labels

OPTION 2: CONCESSION (Use As-Is)
- Use product that does not fully meet spec but is safe and fit for purpose
- Requires:
  * Site Manager approval
  * Customer approval if product already shipped or customer spec affected
  * Technical justification (why product is still acceptable)
  * Limited to specific batch (not ongoing)
- Example: Seal strength 95% of spec (spec: 2.0 kg, actual: 1.9 kg) but still functional

OPTION 3: DOWNGRADE (Alternative Use)
- Use product for lower-grade application
- Requires:
  * QA Manager approval
  * New SKU/label reflecting downgrade
  * Customer notification if affects contract
  * Pricing adjustment
- Example: First-grade bags with cosmetic defects sold as second-grade

OPTION 4: SCRAP (Dispose as Waste)
- Destroy product that cannot be salvaged
- Requires:
  * QA Manager approval (all cases)
  * Site Manager approval (finished goods >R50,000)
  * Waste disposal procedure (Procedure 4.10)
  * Financial loss documented
- Example: Contaminated product, severe quality failures

DISPOSITION APPROVAL MATRIX:
| Disposition | Raw Material | WIP | Finished Goods |
|-------------|--------------|-----|----------------|
| Rework      | QA Manager   | QA Manager | QA Manager |
| Concession  | Site Manager | Site Manager | Site Manager + Customer |
| Downgrade   | QA Manager   | QA Manager | QA Manager |
| Scrap (<R50k) | QA Manager | QA Manager | QA Manager |
| Scrap (>R50k) | Site Manager | Site Manager | Site Manager |

5.5 CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS (CAPA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After root cause identified, QA Manager defines CAPA:

IMMEDIATE CORRECTION (within 24 hours):
- Fix the specific problem (e.g., adjust machine, replace faulty component)
- Document action taken
- Verify correction effective

CORRECTIVE ACTION (within 7 days):
- Address root cause to prevent recurrence on this product/line
- Examples:
  * Retrain operators on seal temperature control
  * Calibrate sealing equipment
  * Update work instructions with clearer specifications
  * Implement additional quality check

PREVENTATIVE ACTION (within 30 days):
- Prevent similar issues across all products/lines
- Examples:
  * Review training program for all operators
  * Implement poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) on equipment
  * Add visual management aids (control charts, SPC)
  * Update HACCP/HARA if process control failure

CAPA TRACKING:
- Assign responsibility (who will complete action)
- Set target completion date
- Track status in NCR system
- QA Manager verifies completion
- Effectiveness verification after 30 days (check if issue recurred)
